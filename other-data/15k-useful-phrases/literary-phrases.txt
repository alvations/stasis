A bitterness crept into her face
A blazing blue sky poured down torrents of light
A book to beguile the tedious hours
A brave but turbulent aristocracy
A broad, complacent, admiring imbecility breathed from his nose and lips
A burlesque feint of evading a blow
A callous and conscienceless brute
A calm and premeditated prudence
A calmness settled on his spirit
A campaign of unbridled ferocity
A carefully appraising eye
A ceaselessly fleeting sky
A certain implication of admiring confidence
A charming air of vigor and vitality
A childish belief in his own impeccability
A cold, hard, frosty penuriousness was his prevalent characteristic 
A compassion perfectly angelic
A constant stream of rhythmic memories
A covertly triumphant voice
A creature of the most delicate and rapid responses
A crop of disappointments
A cunning intellect patiently diverting every circumstance to its design
A curious and inexplicable uneasiness
A curious vexation fretted her
A daily avalanche of vituperation 
A dandified, pretty-boy-looking sort of figure
A dark and relentless fate
A day monotonous and colorless
A dazzling completeness of beauty
A deep and brooding resentment
A delicious throng of sensations
A deliciously tantalizing sense
A detached segment of life
A dire monotony of bookish idiom
A disheveled and distraught figure
A face singularly acute and intelligent
A faint accent of reproach
A faint sense of compunction moved her
A faint tremor of amusement was on his lips
A faint, transient, wistful smile lightened her brooding face
A faintly quizzical look came into his incisive stare
A fawn-colored sea streaked here and there with tints of deepest orange
A fever of enthusiasm
A few tears came to soften her seared vision
A fiery exclamation of wrath and disdain
A figure full of decision and dignity
A firm and balanced manhood
A first faint trace of irritation
A fitful boy full of dreams and hopes
A flame of scarlet crept in a swift diagonal across his cheeks
A fleeting and furtive air of triumph
A flood of pride rose in him
A foreboding of some destined change
A fortuitous series of happy thoughts
A frigid touch of the hand
A fugitive intangible charm
A gay exuberance of ambition
A generation of men lavishly endowed with genius
A gentle sarcasm ruffled her anger
A ghastly whiteness overspread the cheek
A glance of extraordinary meaning
A glassy expression of inattention
A glassy stare of deprecating horror
A glittering infectious smile
A gloom overcame him
A golden haze of pensive light
A golden summer of marvelous fertility
A graceful readiness and vigor
A grave man of pretending exterior
A great pang gripped her heart
A great process of searching and shifting
A great sickness of heart smote him
A great soul smitten and scourged, but still invested with the dignity of immortality
A grim and shuddering fascination
A gush of entrancing melody
A gusty breeze blew her hair about unheeded
A half-breathless murmur of amazement and incredulity
A half-uneasy, half-laughing compunction
A harassing anxiety of sorrow
A harvest of barren regrets
A haunting and horrible sense of insecurity
A heavy oppression seemed to brood upon the air
A helpless anger simmered in him
A hint of death in the icy breath of the gale
A hot and virulent skirmish
A hot uprush of hatred and loathing
A kind of ineffable splendor crowns the day
A lapse from the well-ordered decencies of civilization
A large, rich, copious human endowment
A late star lingered, remotely burning
A laugh of jovial significance
A light of unwonted pleasure in her eyes 
A little jaded by gastronomical exertions
A lukewarm and selfish love
A man of imperious will 
A man of matchless modesty and refinement
A manner bright with interest and interrogation
A manner nervously anxious to please
A melancholy monotone beat on one's heart
A mere exhibition of fussy diffuseness
A mere figment of a poet's fancy
A mien and aspect singularly majestic 
A mild and deprecating air
A mind singularly practical and sagacious 
A mouth of inflexible decision
A murmur of complacency
A mystery everlastingly impenetrable
A nameless sadness which is always born of moonlight
A new and overmastering impulse
A new doubt assailed her
A new marvel of the sky
A new trouble was dawning on his thickening mental horizon
A nimble-witted opponent
A painful thought was flooding his mind
A pang of jealousy not unmingled with scorn
A patience worthy of admiration
A perfect carnival of fun
A perfect crime of clumsiness
A piteous aspect of woe
A portent full of possible danger
A potion to be delicately supped at leisure
A powerful agitation oppressed him
A prevailing sentiment of uneasy discontent
A prey to listless uneasiness
A profound and absorbing interest
A profound and eager hopefulness
A profound and rather irritating egotist by nature
A prop for my faint heart
A propitious sky, marbled with pearly white 
A protest wavered on her lip
A puissant and brilliant family 
A queer, uncomfortable perplexity began to invade her
A quick flame leaped in his eyes
A quick shiver ruffled the brooding stillness of the water
A quiver of resistance ran through her
A random gleam of light
A rare and dazzling order of beauty
A remarkable fusion of morality and art
A rhythmical torrent of eloquent prophecy
A river of shame swept over him
A sad inquiry seemed to dwell in her gaze
A satisfied sense of completeness
A secret sweeter than the sea or sky can whisper
A sensation of golden sweetness and delight
A sense of desolation and disillusionment overwhelmed me
A sense of infinite peace brooded over the place
A sense of meditative content
A sense of repression was upon her
A sentiment of distrust in its worth had crept into her thoughts
A sheaf of letters
A shimmer of golden sun shaking through the trees
A shiver of apprehension crisped her skin
A shuffling compromise between defiance and prostration
A sigh of large contentment
A sight for the angels to weep over
A skepticism which prompted rebellion
A slight movement of incredulous dissent
A smile full of subtle charm
A smile of exquisite urbanity
A soft insidious plea
A soft intonation of profound sorrow
A soft suspicion of ulterior motives
A solemn glee possessed my mind
A solemn gray expanse that lost itself far away in the gray of the sea
A solemn utterance of destiny
A somber and breathless calm hung over the deepening eve
A somewhat melancholy indolence
A somewhat sharp and incisive voice
A sonorous voice bade me enter
A soothing and quieting touch was gently laid upon her soul
A sort of eager, almost appealing amiability
A sort of stolid despairing acquiescence
A sort of stunned incredulity
A soundless breeze that was little more than a whisper
A spacious sense of the amplitude of life's possibilities
A staccato cough interrupted the flow of speech
A state of sullen self-absorption
A steady babble of talk and laughter
A step was at her heels
A stifling sensation of pain and suspense
A stinging wind swept the woods
A strange compound of contradictory elements
A stream of easy talk
A strong convulsion shook the vague indefinite form
A strong susceptibility to the ridiculous
A subtle emphasis of scorn
A sudden and stinging delight
A sudden gleam of insight
A sudden uncontrollable outburst of feeling
A super-abundance of boisterous animal spirits
A supercilious scorn and pity 
A super-refinement of taste
A swaggering air of braggadocio 
A sweet bewilderment of tremulous apprehension 
A sweet, quiet, sacred, stately seclusion
A swift knowledge came to her
A swift unformulated fear
A swiftly unrolling panorama of dreams
A tangle of ugly words
A thousand evanescent memories of happy days 
A thousand unutterable fears bore irresistible despotism over her thoughts
A time of disillusion followed
A tiny stream meandering amiably
A tone of arduous admiration
A torn and tumultuous sky
A total impression ineffable and indescribable
A tragic futility
A treacherous throb of her voice
A true similitude of what befalls many men and women
A tumult of vehement feeling
A tumultuous rush of sensations
A twinge of embarrassment
A vague and wistful melancholy
A vast sweet silence crept through the trees
A veritable spring-cleaning of the soul
A very practised and somewhat fastidious critic
A violent and mendacious tongue 
A vivid and arresting presentation
A waking dream overshadowed her
A weird world of morbid horrors
A well-bred mixture of boldness and courtesy
A wild vivacity was in her face and manner
A wile of the devil's 
A wind strayed through the gardens
A withering sensation of ineffable boredom
A wordless farewell
Absolutely vulgarized by too perpetual a parroting
Absorbed in a stream of thoughts and reminiscences
Absorbed in the scent and murmur of the night
Accidents which perpetually deflect our vagrant attention
Across the gulf of years
Administering a little deft though veiled castigation
Affected an ironic incredulity
Affecting a tone of gayety
After a first moment of reluctance
After an eternity of resolutions, doubts, and indecisions
Aghast at his own helplessness
Agitated and enthralled by day-dreams
Agitated with violent and contending emotions
Alien paths and irrelevant junketings
All embrowned and mossed with age
All her gift of serene immobility brought into play
All hope of discreet reticence was ripped to shreds
All the lesser lights paled into insignificance
All the magic of youth and joy of life was there
All the place is peopled with sweet airs
All the sky was mother-of-pearl and tender
All the unknown of the night and of the universe was pressing upon him
All the world was flooded with a soft golden light
All was a vague jumble of chaotic impressions
All was incomprehensible
All was instinctive and spontaneous
Aloof from the motley throng
Ambition shivered into fragments
Amid distress and humiliation
Amid the direful calamities of the time
An acute note of distress in her voice
An agreeably grave vacuity
An air half quizzical and half deferential
An air of affected civility
An air of being meticulously explicit
An air of inimitable, scrutinizing, superb impertinence
An air of stern, deep, and irredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all
An air of uncanny familiarity
An air which was distinctly critical
An almost pathetic appearance of ephemeral fragility 
An almost riotous prodigality of energy
An answering glow of gratitude
An antagonist worth her steel
An artful stroke of policy
An assumption of hostile intent
An assurance of good-nature that forestalled hostility
An atmosphere of extraordinary languor 
An atmosphere thick with flattery and toadyism
An attack of peculiar virulence and malevolence
An audacious challenge of ridicule
An avidity that bespoke at once the restlessness, 
An awe crept over me
An eager and thirsty ear
An easy prey to the powers of folly
An effusive air of welcome
An equal degree of well-bred worldly cynicism
An erect, martial, majestic, and imposing personage
An eternity of silence oppressed him
An expression of mildly humorous surprise
An expression of rare and inexplicable personal energy
An exquisite perception of things beautiful and rare
An iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart
An ignoring eye
An impenetrable screen of foliage
An impersonal and slightly ironic interest
An impervious beckoning motion
An inarticulate echo of his longing
An increased gentleness of aspect
An incursion of the loud, the vulgar and meretricious 
An inexplicable and uselessly cruel caprice of fate
An inexpressible fervor of serenity
An ingratiating, awkward and, wistful grace
An inspired ray was in his eyes
An instant she stared unbelievingly
An intense and insatiable hunger for light and truth
An intense travail of mind
An obscure thrill of alarm
An odd little air of penitent self-depreciation
An open wit and recklessness of bearing
An oppressive sense of strange sweet odor
An optimistic after-dinner mood
An overburdening sense of the inexpressible
An uncomfortable premonition of fear
An unfailing sweetness and unerring perception
An unpleasant and heavy sensation sat at his heart
An unredeemed dreariness of thought
An unsuspected moral obtuseness
An utter depression of soul
And day peers forth with her blank eyes
And what is all this pother about? 
Animated by noble pride
Anticipation painted the world in rose
Appalled in speechless disgust
Appealing to the urgent temper of youth
Apprehensive solicitude about the future
Ardent words of admiration
Armed all over with subtle antagonisms
Artless and unquestioning devotion
As if smitten by a sudden spasm
As the long train sweeps away into the golden distance
August and imperial names in the kingdom of thought
Awaiting his summons to the eternal silence
Bandied about from mouth to mouth
Barricade the road to truth
Bartering the higher aspirations of life
Beaming with pleasurable anticipation
Before was the open malignant sea
Beguiled the weary soul of man
Beneath the cold glare of the desolate night
Bent on the lofty ends of her destiny
Beset by agreeable hallucinations
Beset with smiling hills
Beside himself in an ecstasy of pleasure
Betokening an impulsive character
Beyond the farthest edge of night
Birds were fluting in the tulip-trees
Biting sentences flew about
Black inky night
Blithe with the bliss of the morning
Blown about by every wind of doctrine
Bookish precision and professional peculiarity
Borne from lip to lip
Borne onward by slow-footed time
Borne with a faculty of willing compromise
Bowed with a certain frigid and deferential surprise
Broke in a stupendous roar upon the shuddering air
Browsing at will on all the uplands of knowledge and thought
Buffeted by all the winds of passion
Buried hopes rose from their sepulchers
Buried in the quicksands of ignorance
But none the less peremptorily 
By a curious irony of fate
By a happy turn of thinking
By virtue of his impassioned curiosity
Carried the holiday in his eye
Chafed at the restraints imposed on him
Cheeks furrowed by strong purpose and feeling
Childlike contour of the body
Cleansed of prejudice and self-interest
Cloaked in prim pretense
Clothed with the witchery of fiction
Clutch at the very heart of the usurping mediocrity
Cold gaze of curiosity
Collapse into a dreary and hysterical depression
Comment of rare and delightful flavor
Conjuring up scenes of incredible beauty and terror
Conscious of unchallenged supremacy
Constant indulgence of wily stratagem and ambitious craft
Contemptuously indifferent to the tyranny of public opinion
Covered with vegetation in wild luxuriance
Crisp sparkle of the sea
Crystallize about a common nucleus
Cultivated with a commensurate zeal
Current play of light gossip
Curtains of opaque rain
Dallying in maudlin regret over the past 
Dark with unutterable sorrows
Darkness oozed out from between the trees
Dawn had broken
Day stood distinct in the sky
Days of vague and fantastic melancholy
Days that are brief and shadowed
Deep shame and rankling remorse
Deficient in affectionate or tender impulses
Delicately emerging stars
Delicious throng of sensations
Despite her pretty insolence
Dignity and sweet patience were in her look
Dim opalescence of the moon
Dimly foreshadowed on the horizon
Dimmed by the cold touch of unjust suspicion
Disfigured by passages of solemn and pompous monotony.
Disguised itself as chill critical impartiality
Dismal march of death
Distinguished by hereditary rank or social position
Distract and beguile the soul
Distressing in their fatuous ugliness
Diverted into alien channels
Diverting her eyes, she pondered
Dogs the footsteps
Doled out in miserly measure
Doubt tortured him
Doubts beset her lonely and daring soul
Down the steep of disenchantment
Dreams and visions were surpassed
Dreams that fade and die in the dim west
Drear twilight of realities
Drift along the stream of fancy
Drowned in the deep reticence of the sea
Drowsiness coiled insidiously about him
Dull black eyes under their precipice of brows
Earth danced under a heat haze
Easily moved to gaiety and pleasure
Either way her fate was cruel
Embrace with ardor the prospect of serene leisure
Endearing sweetness and manner
Endeavoring to smile away his chagrin
Endlessly shifting moods
Endowed with all those faculties that can make the world a garden of enchantment
Endowed with life and emphasis
Enduring with smiling composure the near presence of people who are distasteful
Enjoyed with astonishing unscrupulousness
Enticed irresistibly by the freedom of an open horizon
Essay a flight of folly
Evanescent shades of feeling 
Events took an unexpected sinister turn
Every curve of her features seemed to express a fine arrogant acrimony and harsh truculence
Everywhere the fragrance of a bountiful earth
Exasperated by what seemed a wilful pretense of ignorance
Exhibits itself in fastidious crotchets
Expectation darkened into anxiety
Experience and instinct warred within her
Exquisite graciousness of manner
Exquisitely stung by the thought
Familiar and endearing intimacy
Fatally and indissolubly united
Fathomless depths of suffering
Fear held him in a vice
Feeding his scholarly curiosity
Feeling humiliated by the avowal
Felicitousness in the choice and exquisiteness in the collocation of words
Fettered by poverty and toil
Feverish tide of life
Fine precision of intent
Fitful tumults of noble passion
Fleeting touches of something alien and intrusive
Floating in the clouds of reverie
Fluctuations of prosperity and adversity
Flushed with a suffusion that crimsoned her whole countenance
Forebodings possessed her
Foreshadowing summer's end
Forever echo in the heart
Forever sings itself in memory
Formless verbosity and a passionate rhetoric
Fragments of most touching melody
Free from rigid or traditional fetters
Freedom and integrity of soul
Freighted with strange, vague longings
Frosty thraldom of winter 
Fugitive felicities of thought and sensation
Full of dreams and refinements and intense abstractions
Full of majestic tenderness
Gathering all her scattered impulses into a passionate act of courage
Gaze dimly through a maze of traditions
Generosity pushed to prudence
Gleams of sunlight, bewildered like ourselves, struggled, surprised, through the mist and disappeared
Glowing with haste and happiness
Go straight, as if by magic, to the inner meaning
Goaded on by his sense of strange importance
Graceful length of limb and fall of shoulders
Great shuddering seized on her
Green hills pile themselves upon each other's shoulders
Grim and sullen after the flush of the morning
Guilty of girlish sentimentality
Half choked by a rising paroxysm of rage
Half-suffocated by his triumph
Hardened into convictions and resolves
Haughtiness and arrogance were largely attributed to him
Haunt the recesses of the memory
Haunted with a chill and unearthly foreboding
He accosted me with trepidation
He adroitly shifted his ground
He airily lampooned their most cherished prejudices
He bowed submission
He braced himself to the exquisite burden of life
He condescended to intimate speech with her
He conversed with a colorless fluency
He could detect the hollow ring of fundamental nothingness
He could do absolutely naught
He drank of the spirit of the universe
He drew near to a desperate resolve
He evinced his displeasure by a contemptuous sneer or a grim scowl
He felt an unaccountable loathing
He felt the ironic rebound of her words
He flung diffidence to the winds
He flushed crimson
He found the silence intolerably irksome
He frowned perplexedly
He gave her a baffled stare
He gave himself to a sudden day-dream
He gave his ear to this demon of false glory
He grew wanton with success
He had acted with chivalrous delicacy of honor
He had the eye of an eagle in his trade
He had the gift of deep, dark silences
He held his breath in admiring silence
He laughed away my protestations
He lent no countenance to the insensate prattle
He listened greedily and gazed intent
He made a loathsome object
He made the politest of monosyllabic replies
He murmured a civil rejoinder
He murmured a vague acceptance
He mused a little while in grave thought
He never wears an argument to tatters
He only smiled with fatuous superiority
He paused, stunned and comprehending
He perceived the iron hand within the velvet glove
He raised a silencing hand
He ruled autocratically
He sacrificed the vulgar prizes of life
He sat on thorns
He set his imagination adrift
He shambled away with speed
He sighed deeply, from a kind of mental depletion
He smote her quickening sensibilities
He submitted in brooding silence
He suppressed every sign of surprise
He surrendered himself to gloomy thought
He threaded a labyrinth of obscure streets
He threw a ton's weight of resolve upon his muscles
He threw out phrases of ill-humor
He threw round a measuring eye
He treads the primrose path of dalliance
He used an unguarded adjective
He was a tall, dark, saturnine youth, sparing of speech 
He was aware of emotion
He was born to a lively and intelligent patriotism
He was dimly mistrustful of it
He was discreetly silent
He was empty of thought
He was entangled in a paradox
He was giving his youth away by handfuls
He was haunted and begirt by presences
He was measured and urbane
He was most profoundly skeptical
He was nothing if not grandiloquent
He was quaking on the precipice of a bad bilious attack
He was utterly detached from life
He went hot and cold
He would fall into the blackest melancholies
He writhed in the grip of a definite apprehension
He writhed with impotent humiliation
Her blank gaze chilled you
Her bright eyes were triumphant
Her eyes danced with malice
Her eyes dilated with pain and fear
Her eyes were full of wondering interest
Her eyes were limpid and her beauty was softened by an air of indolence and languor 
Her face stiffened anew into a gray obstinacy
Her face was lit up by a glow of inspiration and resolve
Her haughty step waxed timorous and vigilant
Her head throbbed dangerously
Her heart appeared to abdicate its duties
Her heart fluttered with a vague terror
Her heart pounded in her throat
Her heart was full of speechless sorrow
Her hurrying thoughts clamored for utterance
Her imagination recoiled
Her interest flaggedFifteen Thousand Useful Phrases
Her life had dwarfed her ambitions
Her limbs ran to marble
Her lips hardened
Her lips parted in a keen expectancy
Her mind was a store-house of innocuous anecdote
Her mind was beaten to the ground by the catastrophe
Her mood was unaccountably chilled
Her musings took a sudden and arbitrary twist
Her scarlet lip curled cruelly
Her smile was faintly depreciatory
Her smile was linked with a sigh
Her solicitude thrilled him
Her stare dissolved
Her step seemed to pity the grass it prest
Her strength was scattered in fits of agitation
Her stumbling ignorance which sought the road of wisdom
Her thoughts outstripped her erring feet
Her tone was gathering remonstrance
Her tongue on the subject was sharpness itself
Her tongue stumbled and was silent
Her voice had the coaxing inflections of a child
Her voice trailed off vaguely
Her voice was full of temper, hard-held
Her voice, with a tentative question in it, rested in air
Her wariness seemed put to rout
His accents breathed profound relief
His agitation increased
His brow grew knit and gloomy
His brow was in his hand
His conscience leapt to the light
His constraint was excruciating
His curiosity is quenched
His dignity counseled him to be silent
His ears sang with the vibrating intensity of his secret existence
His eyes had a twinkle of reminiscent pleasantry
His eyes literally blazed with savage fire
His eyes shone with the pure fire of a great purpose
His eyes stared unseeingly
His face caught the full strength of the rising wind
His face dismissed its shadow
His face fell abruptly into stern lines
His face lit with a fire of decision
His face showed a pleased bewilderment
His face torn with conflict
His face was gravely authoritative
His gaze faltered and fell
His gaze searched her face
His gaze seemed full of unconquerable hopefulness
His hand supported his chin
His hands were small and prehensible 
His heart asserted itself again, thunderously beating
His heart rebuked him
His heart was full of enterprise
His impatient scorn expired
His last illusions crumbled
His lips loosened in a furtively exultant smile
His lips seemed to be permanently parted in a good-humored smile
His mind echoed with words
His mind leaped gladly to meet new issues and fresh tides of thought
His mind was dazed and wandering in a mist of memories
His mood yielded
His mouth quivered with pleasure
His passions vented themselves with sneers
His pulses leaped anew
His reputation had withered
His sensibilities were offended
His shrewd gaze fixed appraisingly upon her
His soul full of fire and eagle-winged
His soul was compressed into a single agony of prayer
His soul was wrung with a sudden wild homesickness
His speech faltered
His swift and caustic satire
His temper was dark and explosive
His thoughts galloped
His thoughts were in clamoring confusion
His tone assumed a certain asperity 
His torpid ideas awoke again
His troubled spirit shifted its load
His vagrant thoughts were in full career
His voice insensibly grew inquisitorial
His voice was thick with resentment and futile protest
His whole face was lighted with a fierce enthusiasm
His whole frame seemed collapsed and shrinking
His whole tone was flippant and bumptious
His words trailed off brokenly
His youthful zeal was contagious
Hope was far and dim
How sweet and reasonable the pale shadows of those who smile from some dim corner of our memories
Humiliating paltriness of revenge
I capitulated by inadvertence
I cut my reflections adrift
I felt a qualm of apprehension
I suffered agonies of shyness
I took the good day from the hands of God as a perfect gift
I was in a somber mood
I was overshadowed by a deep boding
I was piqued 
I yielded to the ingratiating mood of the day
Ill-bred insolence was his only weapon
Ill-dissimulated fits of ambition
Imbued with a vernal freshness 
Immense and careless prodigality
Immense objects which dwarf us
Immersed in secret schemes
Immured in a trivial round of duty 
Impassioned and earnest language
Impatient and authoritative tones
Impervious to the lessons of experience
Implying an immense melancholy
Imprisoned within an enchanted circle
In a deprecating tone of apology
In a flash of revelation
In a gale of teasing merriment
In a misery of annoyance and mortification
In a musing ecstasy of contemplation
In a sky stained with purple, the moon slowly rose
In a spirit of indulgent irony
In a strain of exaggerated gallantry
In a tone of after-dinner perfunctoriness 
In a tone of musing surprise
In a tumult of self-approval and towering exultation
In a vague and fragmentary way
In a wise, superior, slightly scornful manner
In accents of menace and wrath
In its whole unwieldy compass
In moments of swift and momentous decision
In quest of something to amuse
In requital for various acts of rudeness
In the air was the tang of spring
In the dusky path of a dream
In the face of smarting disillusions
In the flush and heyday of youth and gaiety and loveliness
In the heyday of friendship
In the mild and mellow maturity of age
In the perpetual presence of everlasting verities
In this breathless chase of pleasure
In this chastened mood I left him
Incapable of initiative or boldness
Inconceivable perversion of reasoning
Indolently handsome eyes
Indulge in pleasing discursiveness
Ineffable sensation of irritability
Infantile insensibility to the solemnity of his bereavement
Infantine simplicity and lavish waste
Innumerable starlings clove the air 
Insensible to its subtle influence
Inspired by the immortal flame of youth
Intangible and indescribable essence
Intense love of excitement and adventure
Intimations of unpenetrated mysteries
Into her eyes had come a hostile challenge
Into the purple sea the orange hues of heaven sunk silently
Into the very vestibule of death
Involuntarily she sighed
Involuntary awkwardness and reserve
Involved in a labyrinth of perplexities
It came to him with a stab of enlightenment
It elicited a remarkably clear and coherent statement
It is a flight beyond the reach of human magnanimity
It is a thing infinitely subtle
It is not every wind that can blow you from your anchorage
It lends no dazzling tints to fancy
It moved me to a strange exhilaration
It parted to a liquid horizon and showed the gray rim of the sea
It proved a bitter disillusion
It seemed intolerably tragic
It seemed to exhale a silent and calm authority
It was a breathless night of suspense
It was a desolating vision
It was a night of little ease to his toiling mind
It was a night of stupefying surprises
It was all infinitely soft and refreshing to the eye
It was an evening of great silences and spaces, wholly tranquil
It was sheer, exuberant, instinctive, unreasoning, careless joy
It was the ecstasy and festival of summer
It was torture of the most exquisite kind
Jealousies and animosities which pricked their sluggish blood to tingling
Joy rioted in his large dark eyes
Judging without waiting to ponder over bulky tomes
Kind of unscrupulous contempt for gravity
Kiss-provoking lips
Laden with the poignant scent of the garden honeysuckle
Language of excessive flattery and adulation
Lapped in soft music of adulation
Lapse into pathos and absurdity
Large, dark, luminous eyes that behold everything about them
Latent vein of whimsical humor
Lead to the strangest aberrations
Leaping from lambent flame into eager and passionate fire 
Leave to the imagination the endless vista of possibilities
Life flowed in its accustomed stream
Lights and shadows of reviving memory crossed her face
Lionized by fashionable society
Long intertangled lines of silver streamlets
Lost in a delirious wonder
Lost in irritable reflection
Love hovered in her gaze
Ludicrous attempts of clumsy playfulness and tawdry eloquence
Luke-warm assurance of continued love
Lulled by dreamy musings
Luminous with great thoughts
Magnanimous indifference to meticulous niceties
Making the ear greedy to remark offense
Marching down to posterity with divine honors
Marked out for some strange and preternatural doom
Mawkishly effeminate sentiment
Memories plucked from wood and field
Memory was busy at his heart
Merged in a sentiment of unutterable sadness and compassion
Microscopic minuteness of eye
Misgivings of grave kinds
Mockery crept into her tone
Molded by the austere hand of adversity
Moments of utter idleness and insipidity
mood]
Moods of malicious reaction and vindictive recoil
Morn, in yellow and white, came broadening out of the mountains
Mumble only jargon of dotage
My body is too frail for its moods
Nature seemed to revel in unwonted contrasts 
New ambitions pressed upon his fancy
New dreams began to take wing in his imagination
Night after night the skies were wine-blue and bubbling with stars
Night passes lightly in the open world, with its stars and dews and perfumes
Nights of fathomless blackness
No mark of trick or artifice
Noble and sublime patience
Nursed by brooding thought
Obsessed with the modishness of the hour
Occasional flashes of tenderness and love
Oddly disappointing and fickle
One gracious fact emerges here
One long torture of soul
One of the golden twilights which transfigure the world
Oppressed and disheartened by an all-pervading desolation
Oppressed with a confused sense of cumbrous material 
Outweighing years of sorrow and bitterness
Over and over the paroxysms of grief and longing submerged her
Overhung and overspread with ivy
Overshadowed by a vague depression
Pale and vague desolation
Pallor of reflected glories
Palpitating with rage and wounded sensibility
Panting after distinction
Peace brooded over all
Pelted with an interminable torrent of words
Penetrate beneath the surface to the core
Peopled the night with thoughts
Perpetual gloom and seclusion of life
Pertinent to the thread of the discussion
Pervasive silence which wraps us in a mantle of content
Piles of golden clouds just peering above the horizon
Platitudinous and pompously sentimental
Plaudits of the unlettered mob
Pleasant and flower-strewn vistas of airy fancy
Pledged with enthusiastic fervor
Plumbing the depth of my own fears
Poignant doubts and misgivings
Power of intellectual metamorphosis
Power to assuage the thirst of the soul
Precipitated into mysterious depths of nothingness
Preening its wings for a skyward flight
Pressing cares absorbed him
Pride working busily within her
Proclaimed with joyous defiance
Prodigal of discriminating epithets
Prodigious boldness and energy of intellect
Products of dreaming indolence
Profound and chilling solitude of the spot
Proof of his imperturbability and indifference
Provocative of bitter hostility
Pulling the strings of many enterprises
Purge the soul of nonsense
Quickened and enriched by new contacts with life and truth
Quivering with restrained grief
Radiant with the beautiful glamor of youth
Ransack the vocabulary
Red tape of officialdom
Redolent of the night lamp
Reflecting the solemn and unfathomable stars
Regarded with an exulting pride
Rehabilitated and restored to dignity
reminiscent] 
Remorselessly swept into oblivion
Resounding generalities and conventional rhetoric
Respect forbade downright contradiction
Restless and sore and haughty feelings were busy within
Retort leaped to his lips
Rigid adherence to conventionalities
Rudely disconcerting in her behavior
Rudely reminded of life's serious issues
Sacrificed to a futile sort of treadmill
Sadness prevailed among her moods
Scorched with the lightning of momentary indignation
Scorning such paltry devices
Scotched but not slain
Scrupulous morality of conduct
Seem to swim in a sort of blurred mist before the eyes
Seething with suppressed wrath
Seize on greedily
Sensuous enjoyment of the outward show of life
Serenity beamed from his look
Serenity of paralysis and death
Seriousness lurked in the depths of her eyes
Served to recruit his own jaded ideas
Set anew in some fresh and appealing form
Setting all the sane traditions at defiance
Shadowy vistas of sylvan beauty
She affected disdain
She assented in precisely the right terms
She bandies adjectives with the best
She challenged his dissent
She cherished no petty resentments
She curled her fastidious lip
She curled her lip with defiant scorn
She did her best to mask her agitation
She disarmed anger and softened asperity 
She disclaimed fatigue
She fell into a dreamy silence
She fell into abstracted reverie
She felt herself carried off her feet by the rush of incoherent impressions
She flushed an agitated pink
She forced a faint quivering smile
She frowned incomprehension
She had an air of restrained fury
She had an undercurrent of acidity
She hugged the thought of her own unknown and unapplauded integrity
She lingered a few leisurely seconds
She nodded mutely
She nourished a dream of ambition
She permitted herself a delicate little smile
She poured out on him the full opulence of a proud recognition
She questioned inimically 
She recaptured herself with difficulty
She regarded him stonily out of flint-blue eyes
She sat eyeing him with frosty calm
She seemed the embodiment of dauntless resolution
She seemed wrapped in a veil of lassitude
She shook hands grudgingly
She softened her frown to a quivering smile
She spoke with hurried eagerness
She spoke with sweet severity
She stilled and trampled on the inward protest
She stood her ground with the most perfect dignity
She strangled a fierce tide of feeling that welled up within her
She swept away all opposing opinion with the swift rush of her enthusiasm
She thrived on insincerity
She twitted him merrily
She was both weary and placated
She was conscious of a tumultuous rush of sensations
She was demure and dimly appealing
She was exquisitely simple
She was gripped with a sense of suffocation and panic
She was in an anguish of sharp and penetrating remorse
She was oppressed by a dead melancholy
She was stricken to the soul
She wore an air of wistful questioning
Sheer superfluity of happiness
Sickening contrasts and diabolic ironies of life
Silence fell
Singing lustily as if to exorcise the demon of gloom
Skirmishes and retreats of conscience
Slender experience of the facts of life
Slope towards extinction
Slow the movement was and tortuous
Slowly disengaging its significance from the thicket of words
So innocent in her exuberant happiness
Soar into a rosy zone of contemplation
Softened by the solicitude of untiring and anxious love
Solitary and sorely smitten souls
Some dim-remembered and dream-like images
Some exquisite refinement in the architecture of the brain
Some flash of witty irrelevance
Something curiously suggestive and engaging
Something eminently human beaconed from his eyes
Something full of urgent haste
Something indescribably reckless and desperate in such a picture
Something that seizes tyrannously upon the soul
Sore beset by the pressure of temptation
Specious show of impeccability
Spectacular display of wrath
Spur and whip the tired mind into action
Stale and facile platitudes
Stamped with unutterable and solemn woe
Startled into perilous activity
Startling leaps over vast gulfs of time
Stem the tide of opinion
Stern emptying of the soul
Stimulated to an ever deepening subtlety
Stirred into a true access of enthusiasm
Stony insensibility to the small pricks and frictions of daily life
Strange capacities and suggestions both of vehemence and pride
Strange laughings and glitterings of silver streamlets
Stripped to its bare skeleton
Strode forth imperiously 
Struck by a sudden curiosity
Struck dumb with strange surprise
Stung by his thoughts, and impatient of rest
Stung by the splendor of the prospect
Subdued passages of unobtrusive majesty
Sublime indifference to contemporary usage and taste
Submission to an implied rebuke
Subtle indications of great mental agitation
Subtle suggestions of remoteness
Such things as the eye of history sees
Such was the petty chronicle
Suddenly a thought shook him
Suddenly overawed by a strange, delicious shyness
Suddenly smitten with unreality
Suddenly snuffed out in the middle of ambitious schemes
Suffered to languish in obscurity
Sugared remonstrances and cajoleries
Suggestions of veiled and vibrant feeling
Summer clouds floating feathery overhead
Sunk in a phraseological quagmire
Sunk into a gloomy reverie
Sunny silence broods over the realm of little cottages
Supreme arbiter of conduct
Susceptibility to fleeting impressions
Sweet smoke of burning twigs hovered in the autumn day
Swift summer into the autumn flowed
Taking the larger sweeps in the march of mind
Tears of outraged vanity blurred her vision
Teased with impertinent questions
Tenderness breathed from her
Tense with the anguish of spiritual struggle
Terror filled the more remote chambers of his brain with riot
Tethered to earth
That which flutters the brain for a moment
The accelerated beat of his thoughts
The affluent splendor of the summer day
The afternoon was filled with sound and sunshine
The afternoon was waning
The air and sky belonged to midsummer
The air darkened swiftly
The air is touched with a lazy fragrance, as of hidden flowers
The air was caressed with song
The air was full of fugitive strains of old songs
The air was raw and pointed
The allurements of a coquette
The ambition and rivalship of men
The angry blood burned in his face
The anguish of a spiritual conflict tore his heart
The artificial smile of languor
The awful and implacable approach of doom
The babble of brooks grown audible
The babbledom that dogs the heels of fame
The bait proved incredibly successful
The balm of solitary musing
The beauty straightway vanished
The beckonings of alien appeals
The benign look of a father
The blandishments of pleasure and pomp of power
The blinding mist came down and hid the land
The blue bowl of the sky, all glorious with the blaze of a million worlds
The bound of the pulse of spring
The buzz of idolizing admiration
The caressing peace of bright soft sunshine
The chaotic sound of the sea
The chill of forlorn old age
The chill of night crept in from the street
The chivalric sentiment of honor
The chivalrous homage of respect
The clamorous agitation of rebellious passions
The clouded, restless, jaded mood
The constant iteration of the sea's wail
The contagion of extravagant luxury
The conversation became desultory 
The crowning touch of pathos
The current of his ideas flowed full and strong
The dance whizzed on with cumulative fury
The dawn is singing at the door
The day sang itself into evening
The day was at once redolent and vociferous 
The day was blind with fog
The day was gracious
The days passed in a stately procession
The days when you dared to dream
The debilitating fears of alluring fate
The deep and solemn purple of the summer night
The deep flush ebbed out of his face
The deep tranquillity of the shaded solitude
The deepening twilight filled with shadowy visions
The deepest wants and aspirations of his soul
The delicatest reproof of imagined distrust
The demerit of an unworthy alliance
The desire of the moth for the star
The dimness of the sealed eye and soul
The dreamy solicitations of indescribable afterthoughts
The dying day lies beautiful in the tender glow of the evening
The early morning of the Indian summer day was tinged with blue mistiness
The earth looked despoiled
The east alone frowned with clouds
The easy grace of an unpremeditated agreeable talker
The easy-going indolence of a sedentary life
The echo of its wrathful roar surged and boomed among the hills
The empurpled hills standing up, solemn and sharp, out of the green-gold air
The enchanting days of youth
The eternal questioning of inscrutable fate
The evening comes with slow steps
The evening star silvery and solitary on the girdle of the early night
The exaggerations of morbid hallucinations
The excitement of rival issues
The extraordinary wistful look of innocence and simplicity
The eye of a scrutinizing observer
The eyes burnt with an amazing fire
The eyes filled with playfulness and vivacity
The father's vigil of questioning sorrow
The fine flower of culture
The first recoil from her disillusionment
The flawless triumph of art
The flight of the autumnal days
The flower of courtesy
The fluttering of untried wings
The foreground was incredibly shabby
The fragrance of a dear and honored name
The freshening breeze struck his brow with a cooling hand
The freshness of some pulse of air from an invisible sea
The fruit of vast and heroic labors
The general effect was of extraordinary lavish profusion
The give and take was delicious
The gloom of the afternoon deepened
The gloom of winter dwelt on everything
The gloomy insolence of self-conceit
The glow of the ambitious fire
The golden gloom of the past and the bright-hued hope of the future
The golden riot of the autumn leaves
The golden sunlight of a great summer day
The gray air rang and rippled with lark music
The grimaces and caperings of buffoonery
The grotesque nightmare of a haunting fear
The hand of time sweeps them into oblivion
The haunting melody of some familiar line of verse
The haunting phrase leaped to my brain
The headlong vigor of sheer improvisation
The heights of magnanimity and love
The high-bred pride of an oriental
The hills were clad in rose and amethyst
The hill-tops gleam in morning's spring
The hinted sweetness of the challenge aroused him
The hot humiliation of it overwhelmed her
The hungry curiosity of the mind
The idiosyncratic peculiarities of thought
The idle chatter of the crowd
The immediate tyranny of a present emotion
The inaccessible solitude of the sky
The incarnation of all loveliness
The incoherent loquacity of a nervous patient 
The indefinable air of good-breeding
The indefinable yearning for days that were dead
The indefinite atmosphere of an opulent nature
The intercepted glances of wondering eyes
The intrusive question faded
The invidious stigma of selfishness 
The iron hand of oppression
The irresistible and ceaseless onflow of time
The irrevocable past and the uncertain future
The landscape ran, laughing, downhill to the sea
The leaden sky rests heavily on the earth
The leaves of time drop stealthily
The leaves syllabled her name in cautious whispers
The lights winked
The little incident seemed to throb with significance
The lofty grace of a prince
The loud and urgent pageantry of the day
The low hills on the horizon wore a haze of living blue
The machinations of a relentless mountebank 
The machinations of an unscrupulous enemy
The magical lights of the horizon
The majestic solemnity of the moment yielded to the persuasive warmth of day
The marvelous beauty of her womanhood
The maximum of attainable and communicable truth
The melancholy day weeps in monotonous despair
The melodies of birds and bees
The memory of the night grew fantastic and remote
The meticulous observation of facts
The mind freezes at the thought
The mind was filled with a formless dread
The mocking echoes of long-departed youth
The moment marked an epoch
The moon is waning below the horizon
The more's the pity
The morning beckons
The morning droned along peacefully
The most servile acquiescence
The multiplicity of odors competing for your attention
The murmur of soft winds in the tree-tops
The murmur of the surf boomed in melancholy mockery
The murmuring of summer seas
The music and mystery of the sea
The music of her delicious voice
The music of her presence was singing a swift melody in his blood
The music of unforgotten years sounded again in his soul
The mute melancholy landscape
The mystery obsessed him
The naked fact of death
The nameless and inexpressible fascination of midnight music
The narrow glen was full of the brooding power of one universal spirit
The nascent spirit of chivalry
The night was drowned in stars
The old ruddy conviction deserted me
The onrush and vividness of life
The opulent sunset
The orange pomp of the setting sun
The oscillations of human genius
The outpourings of a tenderness reawakened by remorse
The pageantry of sea and sky
The palest abstractions of thought
The palpitating silence lengthened
The panorama of life was unrolled before him
The paraphernalia of power and prosperity
The parting crimson glory of the ripening summer sun
The past slowly drifted out of his thought
The pendulous eyelids of old age
The penetrating odors assailed his memory as something unforgettable
The pent-up intolerance of years of repression
The perfume of the mounting sea saturated the night with wild fragrance
The piquancy of the pageant of life 
The pith and sinew of mature manhood
The plenitude of her piquant ways 
The presage of disaster was in the air
The pressure of accumulated misgivings
The preternatural pomposities of the pulpit
The pristine freshness of spring
The pull of soul on body
The pulse of the rebounding sea
The purging sunlight of clear poetry
The purple vaulted night
The question drummed in head and heart day and night
The question irresistibly emerged
The quick pulse of gain
The radiant serenity of the sky
The radiant stars brooded over the stainless fields, white with freshly fallen snow
The restlessness of offended vanity
The retreating splendor of autumn
The rising storm of words
The river ran darkly, mysteriously by
The river sang with its lips to the pebbles
The roar of the traffic rose to thunder
The romantic ardor of a generous mind
The room had caught a solemn and awful quietude
The rosy twilight of boyhood
The rosy-hued sky went widening off into the distance
The royal arrogance of youth
The sadness in him deepened inexplicably
The scars of rancor and remorse
The scent of roses stole in with every breath of air
The sea heaved silvery, far into the night
The sea slept under a haze of golden winter sun
The sea-sweep enfolds you, satisfying eye and mind
The sea-wind buffeted their faces
The secret and subduing charm of the woods
The see-saw of a wavering courage
The sentimental tourist will be tempted to tarry
The shadows of the night seemed to retreat
The shadows rested quietly under the breezeless sky
The shafts of ridicule
The sheer weight of unbearable loneliness
The shiver of the dusk passed fragrantly down the valley
The silence grew stolid
The silence was uncomfortable and ominous
The silent day perfumed with the hidden flowers
The silver silence of the night
The sinking sun made mellow gold of all the air
The sky grew brighter with the imminent day
The sky grew ensaffroned with the indescribable hue that heralds day
The sky put on the panoply of evening
The sky was a relentless, changeless blue
The sky was dull and brooding
The sky was heavily sprinkled with stars
The sky was turning to the pearly gray of dawn
The smiling incarnation of loveliness
The song of hurrying rivers
The sound of the sea waxed
The spacious leisure of the forest
The spell of a deathless dream was upon them
The stars looked down in their silent splendor
The stars seemed attentive
The star-strewn spaces of the night
The steadfast mind kept its hope
The steady thunder of the sea accented the silence
The still voice of the poet
The stillness of a forced composure
The stillness of the star-hung night
The strangest thought shimmered through her
The stream forgot to smile
The streams laughed to themselves
The strident discord seemed to mock his mood
The stunning crash of the ocean saluted her
The subtle emanation of other influences seemed to arrest and chill him
The sudden rush of the awakened mind
The summit of human attainment
The sun blazed torridly
The sun goes down in flame on the far horizon
The sun lay golden-soft over the huddled hills
The sunlight spread at a gallop along the hillside
The sunset was rushing to its height through every possible phase of violence and splendor
The suspicion of secret malevolence
The swelling tide of memory
The swing of the pendulum through an arch of centuries
The tempered daylight of an olive garden
The tender grace of a day that is fled
The tension of struggling tears which strove for an outlet
The thought leaped
The timely effusion of tearful sentiment
The tone betrayed a curious irritation
The torture of his love and terror crushed him
The trees rustled and whispered to the streams
The tumult in her heart subsided
The tumult in her mind found sudden speech
The tumult of pride and pleasure
The tune of moving feet in the lamplit city
The tyranny of nipping winds and early frosts
The unmasked batteries of her glorious gray eyes
The vacant fields looked blankly irresponsive
The vast and shadowy stream of time
The vast cathedral of the world
The vast unexplored land of dreams
The velvet of the cloudless sky grew darker, and the stars more luminous
The veneer of a spurious civilization
The very pulsation and throbbing of his intellect
The very silence of the place appeared a source of peril
The vision fled him
The vivifying touch of humor
The web of lies is rent in pieces
The wheel of her thought turned in the same desolate groove
The whispering rumble of the ocean
The white seething surf fell exhausted along the shore
The whole exquisite night was his
The whole sea of foliage is shaken and broken up with little momentary shiverings and shadows
The wide horizon forever flames with summer
The wild whirl of nameless regret and passionate sorrow
The wild winds flew round, sobbing in their dismay
The wind charged furiously through it, panting towards the downs
The wind piped drearily
The wind was in high frolic with the rain
The winnowed tastes of the ages
The woods were silent with adoration
The youth of the soul
The zenith turned shell pink
Their ephemeral but enchanting beauty had expired forever 
Their eyes met glancingly
Their troth had been plighted
There was a kind of exhilaration in this subtle baiting
There was a mild triumph in her tone
There was a mournful and dim haze around the moon
There was a strange massing and curving of the clouds
There was a thrill in the air
There was a time I might have trod the sunlit heights
There was no glint of hope anywhere
There was no menace in the night's silvern calmness
There was something so kindly in its easy candor
There was spendthrift grandeur
These qualities were raised to the white heat of enthusiasm
They became increasingly turbid and phantasmagorical 
They escaped the baffled eye
They sit heavy on the soul
They were vastly dissimilar
This exquisite conjunction and balance
This little independent thread of inquiry ran through the texture of his mind and died away
This shadowy and chilling sentiment unaccountably creeps over me
Thought shook through her in poignant pictures
Thoughts came thronging in panic haste
Thrilled by fresh and indescribable odors
Thrilled to the depths of her being
Thrilled with a sense of strange adventure
Through a cycle of many ages
Through endless and labyrinthine sentences
Time had passed unseen
Tinsel glitter of empty titles
Tired with a dull listless fatigue
To all intents and purposes
To speak with entire candor
To stay his tottering constancy
To the scourging he submitted with a good grace
Tossed disdainfully off from young and ardent lips
Touched every moment with shifting and enchanting beauty
Touched with a bewildering and elusive beauty
Transcendental contempt for money
Transformed with an overmastering passion
Trouble gathered on his brow
Turning the world topsy-turvey
Twilight creeps upon the darkening mind
Unapproachable grandeur and simplicity
Unaware of her bitter taunt
Under the vivifying touch of genius
Unearthly in its malignant glee
Unfathomed depths and impossibilities
Unforced and unstudied depth of feeling
Unspoiled by praise or blame
Unspoken messages from some vaster world
Unstable moral equilibrium of boyhood
Until sleep overtakes us at a stride
Untouched by the ruthless spirit of improvement
Upon the mountain-tops of meditation
Urbanely plastic and versatile
Uttering grandiose puerilities 
Vain allurements of folly and fashion
Variously ramified and delicately minute channels of expression
Varnished over with a cold repellent cynicism
Vast sweep of mellow distances
Veiled by some equivocation
Vibrant with the surge of human passions
Vicissitudes of wind and weather 
Vigor and richness of resource
Visible and palpable pains and penalties
Voices that charm the ear and echo with a subtle resonance in the soul
Volcanic upheavings of imprisoned passions
Wantonly and detestably unkind
Waylay Destiny and bid him stand and deliver
Wayward and strangely playful responses
Wearing the white flower of a blameless life
What sorry and pitiful quibbling
When a pleasant countryside tunes the spirit to a serene harmony of mood
When music is allied to words
When the frame and the mind alike seem unstrung and listless
When the profane voices are hushed
When the waves show their teeth in the flying breeze
Whilst the morn kissed the sleep from her eyes
Whistled life away in perfect contentment
Wholly alien to his spirit
With a vanquished and weary sigh
Womanly fickleness and caprice
Words and acts easily wrenched from their true significance
Worn to shreds by anxiety
Wrapped in a sudden intensity of reflection
Wrapped in an inaccessible mood
Wrapped in scudding rain
Wrapt in his odorous and many-colored robe
Wrapt in inward contemplation
Wrought of an emotion infectious and splendidly dangerous
Wrought out of intense and tragic experience
Yielding to a wave of pity
Your mind enthroned in the seventh circle of content
