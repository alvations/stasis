abashed into silence
beguile into reading
betray into speech
blending into harmony
bring into disrepute
bullied into silence
burn into memory
burst into view
call into question
carry into conflict
chill into apathy
coming into vogue
cringe into favor
crumbled into dust
crystallized into action
dash into fragments
deepen into confusion
degenerate into monotony
deluded into believing
descent into death
dissolve into nothingness
dragged into pursuit
drawn into controversy
dribbling into words
driven into servitude
dulled into acquiescence
electrify into activity
elevated into importance
enquire into precedents
enter into controversy
expand into weakness
fade into insignificance
fall into decay
fashion into festoons
flame into war
flower into sympathy
forced into action
frozen into form
fuse into unity
galvanize into life
go into raptures
goaded into action
hushed into silence
incursions into controversy
insight into truth
inveigled into dispute 
kindle into action
lapse into pedantry 
lash into silence
launch into disapproval
lead into captivity
leap into currency
lulled into indifference
melt into space
merge into character
pass into oblivion
plunge into despair
pour into print
quicken into life
relapse into savagery
rendered into music
resolve into nothingness
retreat into silence
ripened into love
rush into print
shocked into attention
sink into insignificance
smitten into ice
snubbed into quiescence
stricken into silence
summoned into being
swollen into torrents
take into account
thrown into disorder
transform into beauty
translated into fact
usher into society
vanish into mystery
wander into digression
wheedled into acquiescence
withdraw into solitude
