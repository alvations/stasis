A most extraordinary idea!
A thousand hopes for your success
Accept my best wishes
All that is conjecture
Allow me to congratulate you
An unfortunate comparison, don't you think?
And even if it were so?
And how am I to thank you?
And in the end, what are you going to make of it?
And yet the explanation does not wholly satisfy me
Apparently I was wrong
Are we wandering from the point?
Are you a trifle--bored?
Are you fully reconciled?
Are you not complicating the question?
Are you prepared to go to that length?
Are you still obdurate? 
As it happens, your conjecture is right
Assuredly I do
At first blush it may seem fantastic
Banish such thoughts
But are you not taking a slightly one-sided point of view?
But consider for a moment
But I look at the practical side
But I wander from my point
But now I'll confide something to you
But perhaps I'm hardly fair when I say that
But seriously speaking, what is the use of it?
But surely that is inconsistent
But that's a tremendous hazard
But the thing is simply impossible
But there's one thing you haven't said
But what do you yourself think about it?
But who could foresee what was going to happen?
But you are open to persuasion?
But you do not know for certain
But you must tell me more
But, wait, you haven't heard the end
By a curious chance, I know it very well
By no means desirable, I think
Can I persuade you?
Can you imagine anything so horrible?
Certain circumstances make it undesirable
Certainly not, if it displeases you
Certainly, with the greatest pleasure
Come, where's your sense of humor?
Consult me when you want me--at any time
Decidedly so
Dine with me to-morrow night?--if you are free?
Do I presume too much?
Do I seem very ungenerous?
Do not misunderstand me
Do not the circumstances justify it?
Do you attach any particular meaning to that?
Do you know what his chief interests are now?
Do you know, I envy you that
Do you mind my making a suggestion?
Do you press me to tell?
Do you really regard him as a serious antagonist?
Do you think there is anything ominous in it?
Does it please you so tremendously?
Does it seem incredible?
Don't be so dismal, please
Don't delude yourself
Don't let me encroach on your good nature
Don't think I am unappreciative of your kindness
Either way is perplexing
Eminently proper, I think
Everyone looks at it differently
Excuse my bluntness
Fanciful, I should say
For the simplest of reasons
Forgive me if I seem disobliging
Fortunate, to say the least
Frankly, I don't see why it should
Frugal to a degree
Fulsome praise, I call it
Give me your sympathy and counsel
Glorious to contemplate
Good! that is at least something
Gratifying, I am sure
Happily there are exceptions to every rule
Has it really come to that?
Have I incurred your displeasure?
Have you any rooted objection to it?
Have you anything definite in your mind?
Have you reflected what the consequences might be to yourself?
He does me too much honor
He feels it acutely
He has a queer conception of the proprieties
He is a poor dissembler 
He is anything but obtuse
He is so ludicrously wrong
He is the most guileless of men
He was so extremely susceptible
He writes uncommonly clever letters
Heaven forbid that I should wound your sensibility
His sense of humor is unquenchable
How amiable you are to say so
How can I tell you how much I have enjoyed it all?
How can I thank you?
How can you be so unjust?
How delightful to meet you
How does the idea appeal to you?
How droll you are!
How extraordinary!
How intensely interesting!
How perfectly delightful!
How utterly abominable
How very agreeable this is!
How very interesting
How very surprising
How well you do it!
However, I should like to hear your views
Human nature interests me very much indeed
I admire your foresight
I admit it most gratefully
I agree that something ought to be done
I agree--at least, I suppose I do
I always welcome criticism so long as it is sincere
I am absolutely bewildered
I am afraid I am not familiar enough with the subject
I am afraid I cannot suggest an alternative
I am afraid I must confess my ignorance
I am afraid I've allowed you to tire yourself
I am afraid you will call me a sentimentalist
I am always glad to do anything to please you
I am anxious to discharge the very onerous debt I owe you
I am appealing to your sense of humor
I am at your service
I am bound to secrecy
I am compelled to, unluckily
I am curious to learn what his motive was
I am deeply flattered and grateful
I am delighted to hear you say so
I am dumb with admiration
I am entirely at your disposal
I am extremely glad you approve of it
I am far from believing the maxim
I am fortunate in being able to do you a service
I am giving you well-deserved praise
I am glad to be able to think that
I am glad to have had this talk with you
I am glad to say that I have entirely lost that faculty
I am glad you can see it in that way
I am glad you feel so deeply about it
I am going to make a confession
I am grateful for your good opinion
I am honestly indignant
I am in a chastened mood
I am inclined to agree with you
I am incredulous
I am indebted to you for the suggestion
I am listening--I was about to propose
I am lost in admiration
I am luckily disengaged to-day
I am more grieved than I can tell you
I am naturally overjoyed
I am not a person of prejudices
I am not an alarmist
I am not as unreasonable as you suppose
I am not at all in the secret of his ambitions
I am not capable of unraveling it
I am not going into sordid details
I am not going to let you evade the question
I am not going to pay you any idle compliments
I am not impervious to the obligations involved
I am not in sympathy with it
I am not in the least surprised
I am not inquisitive
I am not prepared to say
I am not sure that I can manage it
I am not vindictive
I am overjoyed to hear you say so
I am perfectly aware of what I am saying
I am persuaded by your candor
I am quite convinced of that
I am quite discomfited
I am quite interested to see what you will do
I am quite ready to be convinced
I am rather of the opinion that I was mistaken
I am ready to make great allowances
I am really afraid I don't know
I am really gregarious
I am sensible of the flattery
I am seriously annoyed with myself about it
I am so glad you think that
I am so sorry--so very sorry
I am sorry to disillusionize you
I am sorry to interrupt this interesting discussion
I am sorry to say it is impossible
I am speaking plainly
I am still a little of an idealist
I am suppressing many of the details
I am sure it sounds very strange to you
I am sure you could pay me no higher compliment
I am sure you will hear me out
I am surprised, I confess
I am sustained by the prospect of a good dinner
I am vastly obliged to you
I am vastly your debtor for the information
I am very far from being a fanatic
I am very glad of this opportunity
I am very grateful--very much flattered
I am wholly in agreement with you
I am willing to accept all the consequences
I am wonderfully well
I am wondering if I may dare ask you a very personal question?
I am your creditor unawares
I am, I confess, a little discouraged
I anticipate your argument
I appreciate your motives
I assure you it is most painful to me
I assure you my knowledge of it is limited
I bear no malice about that
I beg your indulgence
I beg your pardon, but you take it too seriously
I brazenly confess it
I can easily understand your astonishment
I can explain the apparent contradiction
I can find no satisfaction in it
I can hardly agree with you there
I can never be sufficiently grateful
I can only tell you the bare facts
I can scarcely accept the offer
I can scarcely boast that honor
I can scarcely imagine anything more disagreeable
I can sympathize with you
I cannot altogether acquit myself of interested motives
I cannot explain it even to myself
I cannot find much real satisfaction in it
I cannot forbear to press my advantage
I cannot imagine what you mean
I cannot precisely determine
I cannot say definitely at the moment
I cannot say that in fact it is always so
I cannot see how you draw that conclusion
I cannot thank you enough for all your consideration
I can't pretend to make a jest of what I'm going to say
I compliment you on your good sense
I confess, I find it difficult
I could ask for nothing better
I could never forgive myself for that
I dare say your intuition is quite right
I decline to commit myself beforehand
I detest exaggeration
I didn't mean that--exactly
I do not comprehend your meaning
I do not doubt the sincerity of your arguments
I do not exactly understand you
I do not feel sure that I entirely share your views
I do not find it an unpleasant subject
I don't deny that it is interesting
I don't doubt it for a moment
I don't feel that it is my business
I don't insist on your believing me
I don't justify my presumption
I don't know quite why you should say that
I don't know that I can do that
I don't know when I have heard anything so lamentable
I don't know why you should be displeased
I don't make myself clear, I see
I don't pretend to explain
I don't see anything particularly wonderful in it
I don't underrate his kindness
I don't want to disguise that from you
I don't want to exaggerate
I don't want to seem critical
I doubt the truth of that saying
I endorse it, every word
I entirely approve of your plan
I fancy it's just that
I fear I cannot help you
I fear that's too technical for me
I feel a certain apprehension
I feel an unwonted sense of gaiety 
I feel it my duty to be frank with you
I feel myself scarcely competent to judge
I feel very grateful to you for your kind offer
I find it absorbing
I find it rather monotonous
I find this agreeable mental exhilaration
I frankly confess that
I generally trust my first impressions
I give my word gladly
I give you my most sacred word of honor
I had better begin at the beginning
I had no intention of being offensive
I hadn't thought of it in that light
I hardly think that could be so
I have a hundred reasons for thinking so
I have a peculiar affection for it
I have an immense faith in him
I have been constrained by circumstances
I have been decidedly impressed
I have been longing to see more of you
I have been puzzling over a dilemma
I have every reason to think so
I have given you the best proof of it
I have gone back to my first impressions
I have known striking instances of the kind
I have never heard it put so well
I have no delusions on that score
I have not succeeded in convincing myself of that
I have not the influence you think
I have not the least doubt of it
I have often a difficulty in deciding
I have often marveled at your courage
I have quite changed my opinion about that
I have something of great importance to say to you
I have sometimes vaguely felt it
I have the strongest possible prejudice against it
I haven't the remotest idea
I heartily congratulate you
I hope it will not seem unreasonable to you
I hope we may meet again
I hope you will forgive an intruder
I hope you will not think me irreverent
I hope you will pardon my seeming carelessness
I indulge the modest hope
I know it is very presumptuous
I know my request will appear singular
I like it immensely
I like your frankness
I make no reflection whatever
I mean it literally
I might question all that
I mistrust these wild impulses
I most certainly agree with you
I most humbly ask pardon
I must add my congratulations on your taste
I must apologize for intruding upon you
I must ask you one more question, if I may
I must confess I have never thought of that
I must refrain from any comment
I must respectfully decline to tell you
I must take this opportunity to tell you
I need not remind you that you have a grave responsibility
I never heard anything so absurd
I offer my humblest apologies
I owe the idea wholly to you
I partly agree with you
I personally owe you a great debt of thankfulness
I place myself entirely at your service
I place the most implicit reliance on your good sense
I prefer to reserve my judgment
I purposely evaded the question
I quite appreciate the very clever way you put it
I quite see what the advantages are
I realize how painful it must be to you
I really am curious to know how you guessed that
I recollect it clearly
I rely on your good sense
I remember the occasion perfectly
I resent that kind of thing
I respect you for that
I respect your critical faculty
I say it in all modesty
I see disapproval in your face
I see it from a different angle
I see you are an enthusiast
I see your point of view
I seem to have heard that sentiment before
I shall at once proceed to forget it
I shall await your pleasure
I shall be glad if you will join me
I shall be interested to watch it develop
I shall be most proud and pleased
I shall certainly take you at your word
I shall feel highly honored
I shall make a point of thinking so
I shall never forget your kindness
I shall respect your confidence
I should appreciate your confidence greatly
I should be very ungrateful were I not satisfied with it
I should feel unhappy if I did otherwise
I should like your opinion of it
I should not dream of asking you to do so
I should think it very unlikely
I simply cannot endure it
I spoke only in jest
I stand corrected
I suppose I ought to feel flattered
I surmised as much
I sympathize deeply with you
I take that for granted
I think extremely well of it
I think he has very noble ideals
I think I can answer that for you
I think I know what you are going to say
I think it has its charm
I think it is superb!
I think it quite admirable
I think its tone is remarkably temperate
I think that is rather a brilliant idea
I think what you say is reasonable
I think you are quibbling
I think you are rather severe in your opinions
I think you have great appreciation of values
I think you have summed it up perfectly
I think your candor is charming
I thoroughly agree with you
I thought it most amusing
I thought you were seriously indisposed
I trust you will not consider it an impertinence
I understand exactly how you feel about it
I understand your delicacy of feeling
I venture to propose another plan
I very rarely allow myself that pleasure
I want to have a frank understanding with you
I was at a loss to understand the reason for it
I was hoping that I could persuade you
I was on the point of asking you
I was speaking generally
I watched you with admiration
I will answer you frankly
I will listen to no protestations
I will take it only under compulsion
I will tell you what puzzles me
I will think of it, since you wish it
I will, with great pleasure
I wish I could explain my point more fully
I wish I knew what you meant by that
I wish to be perfectly fair
I wish to put things as plainly as possible
I wonder how much truth there is in it?
I wonder if you have the smallest recollection of me?
I would agree if I understood
I wouldn't put it just that way
If ever I can repay it, command me
If I mistake not you were there once?
If I speak strongly, it is because I feel strongly
If I were disposed to offer counsel
If I were sure you would not misunderstand my meaning
If you don't mind my saying so
If you insist upon it
If you will pardon me the frankness
In a manner that sometimes terrifies me
In one respect you are quite right
In that case let me rob you of a few minutes
In what case, for example?
Incredible as it sounds, I had for a moment forgotten
Indeed, but it is quite possible
Indeed, you are wholly wrong
Indeed! How?
Indifferently so, I am afraid
Irony was ten thousand leagues from my intention
Is it sane--is it reasonable?
Is that a fair question?
Isn't it amazing?
Isn't it extraordinarily funny?
Isn't it preposterous?
Isn't that a trifle unreasonable?
Isn't that rather a hasty conclusion?
It always seemed to me impossible
It amuses you, doesn't it?
It blunts the sensibilities
It could never conceivably be anything but popular
It depends on how you look at it
It depends upon circumstances
It doesn't sound plausible to me
It has a lovely situation as I remember it
It has amused me hugely
It has been a relief to talk to you
It has been an immense privilege to see you
It has never occurred to me
It is a curious fact
It is a great pleasure to meet you
It is a huge undertaking
It is a most unfortunate affair
It is a perfectly plain proposition
It is a rather melancholy thought
It is a truth universally acknowledged
It is all very inexcusable
It is all very well for you to be philosophical
It is altogether probable
It is an admirable way of putting it
It is an error of taste
It is an extreme case, but the principle is sound
It is an ingenious theory
It is an uncommonly fine description
It is extremely interesting, I can assure you
It is for you to decide
It is historically true
It is I who should ask forgiveness
It is incredible!
It is indeed generous of you to suggest it
It is inexplicable
It is interesting, as a theory
It is literally impossible
It is merely a mood
It is most unfortunate
It is my deliberately formed opinion
It is my opinion you are too conscientious
It is nevertheless true
It is not a matter of the slightest consequence
It is not always fair to judge by appearances
It is not so unreasonable as you think
It is often very misleading
It is one of the grave problems of the day
It is only a fancy of mine
It is perfectly defensible
It is perfectly trite
It is permissible to gratify such an impulse
It is possible, but I rather doubt it
It is quite an easy matter
It is quite conceivable
It is quite too absurd
It is rather startling
It is really impressive
It is really most callous of you to laugh
It is sheer madness
It is sickening and so insufferably arrogant
It is simply a coincidence
It is the most incomprehensible thing in the world
It is to you that I am indebted for all this
It is true none the less
It is true, I am grieved to say
It is very amusing
It is very far from being a fiction
It is very good of you to do this for my pleasure
It is very ingenious
It is very splendid of you
It is wanton capriciousness
It is your privilege to think so
It makes it all quite interesting
It may sound strange to you
It must be a trifle dull at times
It must be fascinating
It must be very gratifying to you
It must have been rather embarrassing
It seems an age since we've last seen you
It seems entirely wonderful to me
It seems incredible
It seems like a distracting dream
It seems preposterous
It seems the height of absurdity
It seems to me that you have a perfect right to do so
It seems unspeakably funny to me
It seems very ridiculous
It shall be as you wish
It should not be objectionable
It sounds plausible
It sounds profoundly interesting
It sounds rather appalling
It sounds very alluring
It strikes me as rather pathetic
It was an unpardonable liberty
It was inevitable that you should say that
It was most stupid of me to have forgotten it
It was not unkindly meant
It was peculiarly unfortunate
It was really an extraordinary experience
It was so incredible
It was the most amazing thing I ever heard
It was very good of you to come out and join us
It will create a considerable sensation
It will divert your thoughts from a mournful subject
It will give me pleasure to do it
It will not alter my determination
It would be ill-advised
It would interest me very much
It would seem to be a wise decision
It would take too long to formulate my thought
It's a difficult and delicate matter to discuss
It's a matter of immediate urgency
It's absolute folly
It's absurd--it's impossible
It's all nonsense
It's as logical as it can be under the circumstances
It's been a strange experience for you
It's deliciously honest
It's going to be rather troublesome
It's inconceivable that it should ever be necessary
It's mere pride of opinion
It's my chief form of recreation
It's not a matter of vast importance
It's past my comprehension
It's quite wonderful how logical and simple you make it
It's really very perplexing
It's so charming of you to say that
It's so kind of you to come
It's such a bore having to talk about it
It's the natural sequence
It's too melancholy
It's very wonderful
Join us, please, when you have time
Just trust to the inspiration of the moment
Justify it if you can
Let me persuade you
Let me say how deeply indebted I feel for your kindness
Let me speak frankly
Let us grant that for the sake of the argument
Let us take a concrete instance
Many thanks--how kind and good you are!
May I ask to whom you allude?
May I be privileged to hear it?
May I speak freely?
May I venture to ask what inference you would draw from that?
Might I suggest an alternative?
Most dangerous!
My attitude would be one of disapproval
My confidence in you is absolute
My idea of it is quite the reverse
My information is rather scanty
My meaning is quite the contrary
My point of view is different, but I shall not insist upon it
My views are altered in many respects
No, I am speaking seriously
No, I don't understand it
Not at all
Not to my knowledge
Nothing could be more delightful
Now is it very plain to you?
Now you are flippant
Obviously the matter is settled
Of course I am delighted
Of course I don't want to press you against your will
Of course you will do what you think best
Of course, but that again isn't the point
Oh, certainly, if you wish it
Oh, do not form an erroneous impression
Oh, I appreciate that in you!
Oh, that was a manner of speaking
Oh, that's mere quibbling
Oh, that's splendid of you!
Oh, yes, I quite admit that
Oh, yes, you may take that for granted
Oh, you are very bitter
Oh, you may be as scornful as you like
On the contrary, I agree with you thoroughly
On the face of it, it sounds reasonable
One assumption you make I should like to contest
One has no choice to endure it
One must be indulgent under the circumstances
One thing I beg of you
Pardon me, but I don't think so
Pardon me, I meant something different
Perhaps I am indiscreet
Perhaps not in the strictest sense
Perhaps you do not feel at liberty to do so
Perhaps you think me ungrateful
Personally I confess to an objection
Please continue to be frank
Please do not think I am asking out of mere curiosity
Please forgive my thoughtlessness
Please make yourself at home
Pray don't apologize
Pray forgive me for intruding on you so unceremoniously
Pray go on!
Precisely, that is just what I meant
Put in that way it certainly sounds very well
Question me, if you wish
Quibbling, I call it
Quite so
Quite the wisest thing you can do
Rather loquacious, I think 
Reading between the lines
Really? I should have thought otherwise
Really--you must go?
Reassure me, if you can
Reflect upon the possible consequences
Relatively speaking
Reluctantly I admit it
Reverting to another matter
Shall we have a compact?
She has an extraordinary gift of conversation
She is easily prejudiced
She seems uncommonly appreciative
She will be immensely surprised
Show me that the two cases are analogous
So far so good
So I inferred
So much the better for me
So you observe the transformation?
Something amuses you
Sometimes the absurdity of it occurs to me
Speaking with all due respect
Still, you might make an exception
Strangely it's true
Such conduct seems to me unjustifiable
Surely there can be no question about that
Surely we can speak frankly
Surely you sound too harsh a note
Surely you would not countenance that
Tell me in what way you want me to help you
Thank you for telling me that
Thank you for your good intentions
That depends on one's point of view
That doesn't sound very logical
That is a counsel of perfection
That is a fair question, perhaps
That is a humiliating thought
That is a most interesting idea
That is a question I have often proposed to myself
That is a stroke of good fortune
That is a superb piece of work
That is a very practical explanation
That is admirably clear
That is certainly ideal
That is eminently proper
That is hardly consistent
That is inconceivable
That is just like you, if you will forgive me for saying so
That is most fortunate
That is most kind of you
That is most unexpected and distressing
That is not fair--to me
That is not to be lightly spoken of
That is precisely what I mean
That is quite true, theoretically
That is rather a difficult question to answer
That is rather a strange request to make
That is rather awkward
That is really good of you
That is such a hideous idea
That is the most incredible part of it
That is the prevailing idea
That is tragic
That is true and I think you are right
That is very amiable in you
That is very curious
That is very felicitous
That is very gracious
That is what I call intelligent criticism
That is what I meant to tell you
That might involve you in life-long self-reproach
That must be exceedingly tiresome
That ought to make you a little lenient
That reassures me
That shows the infirmity of his judgment
That theory isn't tenable
That was exceedingly generous
That was intended ironically
That was very thoughtful of you
That was very well reasoned
That will blast your chances, I am afraid
That will suit me excellently
That would be somewhat serious
That would be very discreditable
That, at least, you will agree to
The agreement seems to be ideal
The idea is monstrous
The inference is obvious
The notion is rather new to me
The pleasure is certainly not all on your side
The reason is not so far to seek
The same problem has perplexed me
The sentiment is worthy of you
The simplest thing in the world
The situation is uncommonly delicate
The story seems to me incredible
The subject is extremely interesting
The tone of it was certainly hostile
The very obvious moral is this
The whole thing is an idle fancy
Then I have your permission?
Then you merely want to ask my advice?
Then you're really not disinclined?
There are endless difficulties
There are reasons which make such a course impossible
There is a good deal of sense in that
There is a grain of truth in that, I admit
There is food for reflection in that
There is my hand on it
There is no resisting you
There is nothing I should like so much
There is one inevitable condition
There is something almost terrifying about it
There must be extenuating circumstances
They amuse me immensely
This is a most unexpected pleasure
This is charmingly new to me
This is indeed good fortune
This is really appalling
This is really not a laughing matter
Those are my own private feelings
Those things are not forgotten at once
To me it's simply outrageous
To speak frankly, I do not like it
True, I forgot!
Undeniably true
Unfortunately I must decline the proposal
Unlikely to be so
Unquestionably superior
Unwholesome influence, I would say
Very good, I'll do so
Very well, I will consent
Virtually accomplished, I believe
Vivacity is her greatest charm
Vouch for its truth
We are all more or less susceptible
We are drifting away from our point
We are impervious to certain rules
We are merely wasting energy in this duel
We can safely take it for granted
We couldn't have a better topic
We had better agree to differ
We have had some conclusions in common
We must judge it leniently
We must not expose ourselves to misinterpretation
We owe you a debt of gratitude
We shall be glad to see you, if you care to come
We will devoutly hope not
Well done! I congratulate you
Well, as a matter of fact, I have forgotten
Well, I call it scandalous
Well, I confess they don't appeal to me
Well, I'm not going to argue that
Well, more's the pity
Well, perhaps it is none of my affair
Well, that is certainly ideal!
Well, this is good fortune
Well, yes--in a way
Well, you are a dreamer!
What a beautiful idea
What a charming place you have here
What a curious coincidence!
What a pretty compliment!
What a tempting prospect!
What an extraordinary idea!
What are your misgivings?
What can you possibly mean?
What conceivable reason is there for it?
What do you imagine my course should be?
What do you propose?
What is the next step in your argument?
What is there so strange about that?
What unseemly levity on his part
What very kind things you say to me
What would you expect me to do?
What you have just said is even truer than you realize
What you propose is utterly impossible
What, may I ask, is your immediate object?
Who is your sagacious adviser? 
Why ask such embarrassing questions?
Why did you desert us so entirely?
Why do you take it so seriously?
Will you allow me to ask you a question?
Will you be more explicit?
Will you have the kindness to explain?
Will you pardon my curiosity?
Will you permit me a brief explanation?
Would you apply that to everyone?
Would you mind telling me your opinion?
Yes and no
Yes, but that is just what I fail to comprehend
Yes, I dare say
Yes, if you will be so good
Yes, it was extraordinarily fine
Yes, that is my earnest wish
Yes, that's undeniable
Yes? You were saying?
You agree with me, I know
You are a profound philosopher
You are a severe critic
You are delightfully frank
You are greatly to be envied
You are heartily welcome
You are incomprehensible
You are incorrigible
You are kind and comforting
You are most kind
You are not consistent
You are not serious, I hope
You are not seriously displeased with me?
You are quite delightful
You are rather puzzling to-day
You are right to remind me of that
You are unduly distressing yourself
You are very complimentary
You are very gracious
You ask me--but I shouldn't wonder if you knew better than I do
You astonish me greatly
You behaved with great forbearance
You can hardly be serious
You cannot regret it more than I do
You could not pay me a higher compliment
You did it excellently
You did not clearly understand what I meant
You don't seem very enthusiastic
You excite my curiosity
You flatter my judgment
You have a genius for saying the right thing
You have asked me a riddle
You have asked the impossible
You have been wrongly informed
You have done me a great service
You have had a pleasant time, I hope
You have my deepest sympathy
You have my unbounded confidence
You have received a false impression
You have such an interesting way of putting things
You interest me deeply
You judge yourself too severely
You know I'm in an agony of curiosity
You know I'm not given to sentimentality
You know the familiar axiom
You leave no alternative
You look incredulous
You may be sure of my confidence
You may rely on me absolutely
You might make an exception
You must have misunderstood me
You must not fail to command me
You overwhelm me with your kindness
You really insist upon it?
You rebuke me very fairly
You say that as though you were surprised
You see how widely we differ
You see things rose-colored
You see, it's all very vague
You seem to be in a happy mood
You seem to take a very mild interest in what I propose
You shock me more than I can say
You speak in enigmas
You speak with authority
You surely understand my position
You take a great deal for granted
You take a pessimistic view of things
You take me quite by surprise
You will admit I have some provocation
You will become morbid if you are not careful
You will have ample opportunity
You will please not be flippant
You will understand my anxiety
You will, of course, remember the incident
Your argument is facile and superficial
Your consideration is entirely misplaced
Your judgments are very sound
Your logic is as clever as possible
Your opinion will be invaluable to me
Your request is granted before it is made
Your statement is somewhat startling
You're so tremendously kind about it
You're succeeding admirably
You're taking it all much too seriously
You're talking nonsense!
You're very good, I'm sure
