A fact of vast moment
A few words will suffice to answer
A further objection is
A great many people have said
A little indulgence may be due to those
A majority of us believe
A man in my situation has
A more plausible objection is found
A proof of this is
A servile mind can never know
A short time since
A specific answer can be given
A thought occurred to me
Able men have reasoned out
Above all things, let us not forget
Absolutely true it is
Abundant reason is there
Accordingly by reason of this circumstance
Add this instance to
After a careful study of all the evidence
After full deliberation
After reminding the hearer
After this it remains only to say
Again, can we doubt
Again, I ask the gentleman
Again, in this view
Again, it is quite clear that
Again, it is urged
Again, let us compare
Again, very numerous are the cases
Again, we have abundant instances
Against all this concurring testimony
All confess this to be true
All I ask is
All of us know
All that I will say now
All the facts which support this
All the signs of the time indicate
All these things you know
All this being considered
All this is historical fact
All this is very well
All this suggests
All this we take for granted
Allow me for a moment to turn to
Allow me to tell a story
Altho I say it to myself
Am I mistaken in this
Amazing as it may seem
Among many examples
Among the distinguished guests who honor
Among the problems that confront us
An answer to this is now ready
An argument has often been put forward
An example or two will illustrate
An indescribably touching incident
An opinion has now become established
And again, it is said
And again, it is to be presumed
And coming nearer to our own day
And did a man try to persuade me
And do you really think
And everybody here knows
And for myself, as I said
And further, all that I have said
And hence the well-known doctrine
And here again, when I speak
And here allow me to call your attention
And here I am led to observe
And here I come to the closing evidence
And here I have an opportunity
And here I reproach
And here I wish you to observe
And here let me define my position
And here let me give my explanation
And here let us recall to mind
And how is it possible to imagine
And I am bound to say
And I beg of you
And I call on you
And I might say this
And I refuse assent
And I rejoice to know
And I say, it were better for you
And I should in like manner repudiate
And I speak with reverence
And I submit to you
And I trust that you will consider
And I will make a practical suggestion
And I will tell you why
And I would, moreover submit
And if a man could anywhere be found
And if any of you should question
And if I know anything of my countrymen
And if I may presume to speak
And if I take another instance
And if this be true
And if you come to a decision
And if you think it your duty
And in conclusion
And in like manner
And in order to see this
And in thus speaking, I am not denying
And is not this lamentable
And is there not a presumption
And it happens
And it is certainly true
And it is doubtful if
And it is not difficult to see
And it is not plain
And it is one of the evidences
And it is precisely in this
And it is strikingly suggested to us
And it is undeniable, I say
And it is well that this should be so
And last of all
And lest anyone should marvel
And let it be observed
And lo! and behold
And more than this
And next I would ask
And now allow me to call attention
And now behold a mystery
And now consider
And now having discussed
And now I beg that I may be permitted
And now I go back to the statement
And now I have completed my review
And now I have said enough to explain
And now I must touch upon one point
And now if I may take for granted
And now it would be very pleasant for me
And now observe how
And now supposing this point to be settled
And now that I have mentioned
And now the chief points of it
And now the question is asked me
And now, sir, what I had first to say
And now, to close, let me give you
And now, to what purpose do I mention
And of this I am perfectly certain
And quite as difficult is it to create
And right here lies the cause
And so I am reminded of a story
And so I leave these words with you
And so I may point out
And so I might recount to you
And so in the present case
And so on
And so through all phases
And so, again, as regard
And so, in the other cases, I have named
And so, upon every hand
And sometimes it will be difficult
And that gave another distorted view
And the reason is very obvious
And the same holds good
And then again
And then hastily to conclude
And then I may be reminded
And then there is another thought
And then when it is said
And there are reasons why
And there is also this view
And therefore am I truly glad
And therefore it is not unfrequently quoted
And therefore it is not without regret
And this brings me to the last thing
And this is really the sense
And this leads me to say a word
And thus consistently
And thus it is conceivable
And thus it seems to me
And thus we are led on then to further question
And to all this must be added
And to return to the topic
And to this conclusion you must come
And unquestionably
And we are brought to the same conclusion
And what do you suppose will be
And when I have shown to you
And when I recall that event
And when we pass beyond the bounds of
And where, let me ask
And why should I insist
And will you still insist
And with these thoughts come others
And yet I can not but reflect
And yet I feel justified in believing
And yet I think we all feel
And yet let me say to you
And yet one more quotation
And yet this notion is, I conceive
And yet though this be true
And yet we ought, if we are wise
And you may also remember this
And, of course, you are aware
And, sir, a word
Another circumstance that adds to the difficulty
Another consideration which I shall adduce 
Another instance of signal success
Another of these presumptions
Another point is made as clear as crystal
Another reason of a kindred nature
Another reflection which occurs to me
Another sign of our times
Another signal advantage
Another striking instance
Answers doubtless may be given
Are there not many of us
Are we content to believe
Are we forever to deprive ourselves
Are we not startled into astonishment
Are we satisfied to assume
As a general rule I hold
As a last illustration
As a matter of fact
As a proof of this
As an illustration of this truth
As briefly as I may
As far as my limits allow
As far as this is true
As far as this objection relates
As far as we know
As for the rest
As I have now replied to
As I look around on this assembly
As I rise to respond to the sentiment
As I understand this matter
As memory scans the past
As society is now constituted
As some one has well said
As the foregoing instances have shown
As to the particular instance before us
As we shall see in a few moments
As well might we compare
Assuredly it is this
At the outset of this inquiry
At the risk of digression
At the same time, I candidly state
At the utmost we can say
At this juncture
At this solemn moment
Away then with the notion
Be assured, then
Be confident, therefore
Be it so
Be not deceived
Be sure that in spite of
Be these things as they may
Be your interests what they may be
Bear with me for a few moments
Bearing on this point
Before attempting to answer this question
Before going further
Before I close I will particularly remark
Before I come to the special matter
Before I proceed to compare
Being fully of the opinion
Being persuaded then
Believing, as I do
Beyond all question we
Bidden by your invitation to a discussion
Broadly speaking
But after all, I think no one can say
But again, when we carefully consider
But am I wrong in saying
But apart from the fact
But besides these special facts
But can this question
But depend upon it
But despite all this
But do not let us depend
But do you imagine
But doubts here arise
But even admitting these possibilities
But everyone who deserves
But first of all, remark, I beg you
But grave problems confront us
But here I am discussing
But here let me say
But how can we pass over
But how shall I describe my emotions
But however that may be
But I am bound to say
But I am certain from my own experience
But I am very sorry to say
But I am willing enough to admit
But I can at least say
But I can not conceive
But I can promise
But I cherish the hope
But I confess that I should be glad
But I digress
But I do not propose all these things
But I do say this
But I have been insisting simply
But I have heard it argued
But I have no fear of the future
But I leave this train of thought
But I may be permitted to speak
But I may say in conclusion
But I need hardly assert
But I pass that over
But I propose to speak to you
But I repeat
But I resist the temptation
But I return to the question
But I shall go still further
But I simply ask
But I submit the whole subject
But I trust that you will all admit
But I venture to assure you
But I will allude
But I will not further impress any idea
But I would earnestly impress upon you
But if I may even flatter myself
But if I seek for illustrations
But if you want more evidence
But if you wish to know
But in making this assertion
But in my opinion there is no need
But in the course of time
But is it quite possible to hold
But is this any reason why
But it does not follow from this
But it happens very fortunately
But it has been suggested to me
But it is a fact
But it is impossible for one
But it is necessary to explain
But it is no use protesting
But it is not fair to assert
But it is not my intention
But it is not necessary to suppose
But it is not possible to believe
But it is not really so
But it is otherwise with
But it is sometimes said
But it may be doubted whether
But it may happen that I forgot
But it will be a misfortune
But it will naturally be asked
But it will perhaps be argued
But it would be vain to attempt
But let me ask you to glance
But let me before closing refer
But let none of you think
But let us also keep ever in mind
But let us look a little further
But lo! all of a sudden
But mark this
But more than all things else
But my allotted time is running away
But my answer to this objection
But never was a grosser wrong
But not for one moment
But notwithstanding all this
But now look at the effect
But now take notice of
But on the other hand
But on what ground are we
But passing these by
But perhaps I ought to speak distinctly
But perhaps you are not yet weary
But putting these questions aside
But quite contrary to this, you will find
But recollect, I pray you, how
But some other things are to be noted
But some will ask me
But sooner or later
But still, I repeat
But suppose the fact
But surely, you can not say
But that I may not divert you from
But that is not all
But that must be always the impression
But the fact is
But the final value
But the greatest proof of all
But the most formidable problem
But the necessity of the case
But the question may arise
But there is another duty imposed
But there is much more than this
But this I do not hesitate to say
But this I fearlessly affirm
But this I know
But this is a circuitous argument
But this is no place for controversy
But this is not all
But this is what I mean
But this much I affirm as true
But this warns me
But this we may put aside
But to go still further
But to say the truth
But we are met with the assertion
But we are to recollect
But we ask, perhaps
But we may depend upon it
But we think it is not wise
But we want something more for explanation
But what a blunder would be yours
But what is the fact
But what we must needs guard against
But when it is declared
But when we look a little deeper
But while it may be admitted
But who has not seen
But why do I numerate these details
But with these exceptions
But yet nothing can be more splendid
But you should know
But, above all things, let us
But, further, I shall now demonstrate
But, gentlemen, I must be done
But, my friends, pause for a moment
But, sir, it is manifest
But, then, let us ask ourselves
By no means
By the way, I have not mentioned
By this time it will be suspected
Can it be supposed
Can the long records of humanity teach us
Can there be a better illustration
Can we pretend
Can you lightly contemplate
Can you yield yourselves
Cautious and practical thinkers ask
Certain it is
Certainly I am not blind to the faults
Certainly, one can conceive
Clearly enough
Coming back to the main subject
Coming down to modern times
Coming to present circumstances
Common sense indicates
Consequently, I am not discussing this matter
Consider, I beg you, what
Contemplating these marvelous changes
Delude not yourselves with the belief
Depend upon it
Did it ever occur to you
Difficult then as the question may be
Do I need to describe
Do me the honor of believing
Do not imagine
Do not let us conceal from ourselves
Do not suppose for a moment
Do not talk to me of
Do not think me guilty of
Do we not know
Do what you will
Do you ask how that can be
Do you believe this can be truthfully said
Do you not know I am speaking of
Do you remember a concrete instance
Do you think, then
Does any man say
Does it ever occur to you
Does it not seem something like idiocy to
Does it not shock you to think
Does not the event show
Does not the nature of every man revolt
Doubtless the end is sought
Every now and then you will find
Every one has asked himself
Every one therefore ought to look to
Every reader of history can recall
Far from it
Few indeed there are
Few subjects are more fruitful
Few things impress the imagination more
Finally, it is my most fervent prayer
First in my thoughts are
First of all I ask
For behold
For I must tell you
For if any one thinks that there is
For instance, I can fancy
For is it not true
For it is not right to
For let it be observed first
For mark you
For my own part, I believe
For myself, certainly I think
For observe what the real fact is
For one I deny
For so it generally happens
For the sake of my argument
For this is what I say
For this reason, indeed, it is
For we all know
For, be assured of this
For, in truth, if you please to recollect
For, perhaps, after all
For, perhaps, some one may say
Fortunately for us
Fortunately I am not obliged
From one point of view we are
From the circumstances already explained
From the standpoint of
From this statement you will perceive
Generally speaking
God be praised
Grant this true
Granting all this
Had I time for all that might be said
Had my limits allowed it
Happily for us
Hardly less marvelous
Hardly will anyone venture to say
Have I exaggerated
Have you ever noticed
Having taken a view of
Having thus described what appears to me
He is the best prophet who
He seems at times to confuse
He was an eminent instance of
He who is insensible to
Hence arises a grave mischief
Hence it follows
Hence, as I have said
Here again the testimony corroborates
Here arises the eternal question
Here comes the practical matter
Here for a moment I seem
Here I am considering
Here I end my illustrations
Here I must pause for a moment
Here I only insist upon
Here I ought to stop
Here is another strange thing
Here is good hope for us
Here is no question
Here let me meet one other question
Here then I take up the subject
Here then is the key
Here then, we are brought to the question
Here undoubtedly it is
Here we can not but pause to contemplate
Here we come into direct antagonism with
Here we come to the very crux of
Here we have it on high authority
Here, however, it may be objected
Here, then, I am brought to the consideration
Here, then, it is natural at last
Here, then, we are involved
History is replete with predictions
Hitherto I have spoken only of
Holding this view, I am concerned
How can we help believing
How do you account for
How does it happen
How human language staggers when
How infinitely difficult it is
How infinitely superior must it appear
How is this to be explained
How many a time
How momentous, then
How much better, I say, if
How much more rational it would be
How shall I attempt to enumerate
How shall I describe to you
However, I am viewing the matter
However, I will not in any way admit
However, it is to me a very refreshing thing
I abide by my statement
I add a few suggestions
I adduce these facts 
I admire the main drift of
I admit the extreme complexity
I admit, of course, at once
I again ask
I allude to
I always delight to think
I always will assert the right to
I am a great admirer
I am a little at a loss to know
I am about to supplement
I am agitated by conflicting emotions
I am alarmed, indeed, when I see
I am also bound to say
I am also satisfied
I am apprehensive
I am asked to-night to propose
I am assured and fully believe
I am at a loss for adequate terms
I am bold to say
I am but saying
I am by no means certain
I am certain that you will give me credit
I am certainly in earnest sympathy
I am confronted by the hope
I am conscious of the fact
I am convinced by what I have seen
I am deeply imbued with the conviction
I am deeply insensible of the compliment
I am determined
I am even bold enough to hazard
I am exceeding my necessary limits
I am exceedingly glad of this opportunity
I am extremely obliged to you
I am familiar with
I am far from asserting
I am filled with admiration
I am firmly convinced
I am free to admit
I am fully convinced
I am giving voice to what you all feel
I am glad of this public opportunity
I am glad to answer to the toast
I am glad to express the belief
I am glad to notice
I am going to spare you and myself
I am grateful to you for this honor
I am greatly alarmed
I am greatly indebted to you
I am happy to be with you
I am here by the favor of your invitation
I am here the advocate of
I am here to introduce
I am in favor of
I am in sympathy with
I am inclined sometimes to believe
I am inclined to suspect
I am indebted for the honor
I am informed
I am led on by these reflections
I am led to believe
I am mainly concerned
I am most deeply sensible of the welcome
I am most grateful for the opportunity
I am myself greatly indebted
I am nevertheless too sensible
I am not a stranger to
I am not about to defend
I am not advocating
I am not altogether clear
I am not at liberty to discuss
I am not at present concerned
I am not aware of a single instance
I am not blind to the faults of
I am not bold enough to
I am not catching at sharp arguments
I am not concerned to argue
I am not defending myself
I am not dreaming of denying
I am not going into vexed questions
I am not going to reproach
I am not here to defend
I am not insensible
I am not of those who pretend
I am not prepared to dispute the word
I am not presumptuous to assert
I am not proposing to set forth
I am not ripe to pass sentence
I am not so unreasonable as to tell you
I am not surprised
I am not taking into account
I am not unaware
I am not undertaking to deliver
I am now going to attempt
I am obliged to add
I am obliged to go still further
I am often reminded
I am old enough to remember
I am one of those who believe
I am only too sensible of the fact
I am perfectly willing to admit
I am persuaded
I am prepared to back that opinion by
I am privileged to speak to
I am quite conscious that
I am rather disposed to think
I am ready to do battle
I am reassured by the presence here
I am reluctantly but forcibly reminded
I am resolved not to permit
I am sensible, sir
I am simply endeavoring to show
I am so surrounded on every hand
I am sometimes inclined to think
I am somewhat relieved to know
I am sorry to say
I am suggesting the reason why
I am sure every impartial man will agree
I am sure I feel no hostility
I am sure that I echo the sentiment
I am sure this generous audience will pardon me
I am sure you all hope
I am sure you feel the truth
I am sure you will acquit me
I am sure you will be kind enough
I am sure you will do me the justice
I am sure you will not be surprised
I am sure, at any rate
I am surely not here to assert
I am tempted further to offer to you
I am thankful for the privilege
I am thoroughly convinced
I am to speak to you this evening
I am to urge the interest of
I am told occasionally
I am told on authority
I am too well aware of the difficulties
I am totally at a loss to conceive
I am trespassing too long on your time
I am unable to understand
I am unconscious of intentional error
I am under a very great obligation
I am under the deepest feeling of gratitude
I am under the impression
I am unwillingly bound to add
I am uttering no paradox when I say
I am very far from thinking.
I am very glad to have the honor
I am very happy to be here
I am very much in the condition of
I am very sure that if you ponder
I am very sure you will believe
I am well aware
I am willing to know
I am, indeed, most solicitous
I anticipate with pleasing expectation
I appeal in the first place
I appeal to any man to say
I appeal to the better judgment
I appreciate the significance
I argue this cause
I ask again
I ask no greater blessing
I ask permission to speak to you
I ask the attention
I ask the audience
I ask the audience to return with me
I ask this of you
I ask you calmly and dispassionately
I ask you gentlemen, do you think
I ask you if it is possible
I ask you in all candor
I ask you now to follow me
I ask you to consider
I ask you to join me in drinking a toast
I ask you to pledge with me
I ask you, if you please, to rise and give the toast
I ask your attention
I ask your indulgence
I assert, sir, that it is
I assure myself
I assure you, of my own personal knowledge
I attribute it to
I avail myself of the opportunity
I beg again to thank you for the honor
I beg all to remember
I beg and implore of you
I beg emphatically to say
I beg leave to make some observations
I beg of you to remember
I beg to tender my most fervent wishes
I beg you not to mistake my meaning
I beg you to accept my grateful expression
I begin by observing
I begin with expressing a sentiment
I believe from my own personal experience
I believe I can speak for all
I believe I shall make it clear to you
I believe I voice the sentiment
I believe it to be the simple truth
I believe most profoundly
I believe that I am within the mark
I believe that in this instance
I bid you a most cordial and hearty welcome
I bow with you in reverent commemoration
I call hardly conceive
I call never sufficiently express my gratitude
I call on you to answer
I call to mind how
I can by no calculation justify
I can make allowance for
I can most truthfully assure you
I can not allow myself to believe
I can not avoid confessing
I can not be content with
I can not believe, I will not believe
I can not better illustrate this argument
I can not better sum up
I can not boast of
I can not bound my vision
I can not but reflect
I can not but see what mischief
I can not charge myself with
I can not close without giving expression
I can not conceive a greater honor
I can not feel any doubt myself
I can not forbear from offering
I can not give you a better illustration
I can not help expressing a wish
I can not help speaking urgently
I can not here go into details
I can not hesitate to say
I can not hope adequately to respond
I can not justly be responsible because
I can not let this opportunity pass
I can not persuade myself
I can not prevail on myself
I can not refrain from saying for myself
I can not resist the train of thought
I can not say how glad I am
I can not say with confidence
I can not stop to give in detail
I can not sufficiently thank you
I can not take back my word
I can not take it for granted
I can not thank you enough
I can not well avoid saying
I can only congratulate you
I can only hope for indulgence
I can readily understand
I can scarcely concede anything more important
I can scarcely find fitting words
I can strongly recommend
I can understand, moreover
I can with propriety speak here
I certainly have not so good an opinion
I challenge any man
I cheerfully own
I cheerfully submit myself
I claim a share also for
I class them altogether under the head
I close with the words
I close with this sentiment
I come at length to
I come next to the question of
I come to the other assumption
I conceive this to be
I confess I feel not the least alarmed
I confess I have had my doubts
I confess I have little sympathy
I confess it affects me very deeply to
I confess it is very difficult to
I confess that I do not entirely approve
I confess that it is a comfort to me
I confess that my notions are widely different
I confess to a little embarrassment
I confess to you that I have no fear
I confine myself to saying
I congratulate you upon the auspicious character
I consider I have said enough in proof
I consider it amply explains
I contend
I content myself with pursuing
I could do no less than
I could easily mention
I could enlarge upon it
I could never understand
I could wish that this belief
I dare say you know
I dare venture the remark
I declare to you
I deem it both necessary and just
I deem it proper here to remind
I deem myself honored
I deny the inference
I deny, once and for all
I desire to be brief
I desire to bear my testimony
I desire to call attention
I desire to know
I desire to lay emphatic stress
I dissent from the opinion
I distrust all general theories of
I do again and again urge upon you
I do not absolutely assert
I do not advocate
I do not argue
I do not ask you to
I do not at this moment remember
I do not believe it possible
I do not belong to those who
I do not choose to consume
I do not complain of
I do not consider it necessary
I do not contend
I do not countenance for a moment
I do not deem it incumbent upon me
I do not depreciate for a moment
I do not desire to call in question
I do not desire to put too much emphasis
I do not despair of surmounting
I do not disguise the fact
I do not enter into the question
I do not fail to admire
I do not fear a contradiction
I do not feel at liberty
I do not forget the practical necessity
I do not hesitate to say
I do not imagine
I do not in the least degree
I do not indeed deny
I do not indulge in the delusion
I do not know how anyone can believe
I do not know whether you are aware of it
I do not know why
I do not know with what correctness
I do not mean anything so absurd
I do not mean now to go further than
I do not mean to impute
I do not merely urge
I do not mistrust
I do not myself pretend to be
I do not need to remind you
I do not pretend to argue
I do not propose to take up your time
I do not question for a moment
I do not recount all
I do not say anything about the future
I do not say this with any affectation
I do not see how it is possible
I do not see much difference between
I do not seek to palliate
I do not speak exclusively
I do not stop to discuss
I do not think it necessary to warn you
I do not think it possible
I do not think it unfair reasoning
I do not think myself obliged to dwell
I do not think that I need further discuss
I do not think this at all an exaggeration
I do not think we can go far wrong
I do not think you will often hear
I do not understand how it can apply
I do not vouch for
I do not want to discourage you
I do not wish to be considered egotistic
I do not wish to be misrepresented
I do not wonder
I do not, of course, deny
I do not, therefore, wonder
I do, indeed, recollect
I doubt very much whether
I dwell with pleasure on the considerations
I earnestly maintain
I embrace with peculiar satisfaction
I end as I began
I entertain great apprehension for
I entertain no such chimerical hopes 
I entertain the hope and opinion
I entirely dissent from the view
I especially hail with approval
I even add this
I even venture to deny
I fancy I hear you say
I fear I may seem trifling
I fear lest I may
I fearlessly appeal
I fearlessly challenge
I feel a great necessity to
I feel bound to add my expression
I feel constrained to declare
I feel entirely satisfied
I feel I have a right to say
I feel it a proud privilege
I feel keenly myself impelled by every duty
I feel only a great emotion of gratitude
I feel respect and admiration
I feel some explanation is due
I feel sure
I feel tempted to introduce here
I feel that I have a special right to
I feel that it is not true
I feel the greatest satisfaction
I feel the task is far beyond my power
I fervently trust
I find it difficult to utter in words
I find it more easy
I find my reference to this
I find myself called upon to say something
I find myself in the position of
I find no better example than
I find no fault with
I find numberless cases
I flatter myself
I forbear to inquire
I foresaw the consequence
I fully recognize
I gave notice just now
I give you, in conclusion, this sentence
I go further
I grant all this
I grant with my warmest admiration
I gratefully accept
I greatly deplore
I had a kind of hope
I had almost said
I had in common with others
I had occasion to criticize
I happen to differ
I hardly dare to dwell longer
I hardly know anything more strange
I hasten to concede
I have a dark suspicion
I have a great admiration for
I have a pleasing and personal duty
I have a profound pity for those
I have a right to consider
I have a strong belief
I have a very high respect for
I have abstained from
I have acquired some useful experience
I have all along implied
I have all but finished
I have already alluded to
I have already shown the ground of my hope
I have already stated, and now repeat
I have always been under the impression
I have always listened with the greatest satisfaction
I have always maintained
I have another objection
I have another observation to add
I have anticipated the objection
I have assumed throughout
I have attempted thus hastily
I have barely touched some of the points
I have been allowed the privilege
I have been asked several times
I have been extremely anxious
I have been given to understand
I have been glad to observe
I have been heretofore treating
I have been insisting then on this
I have been interested in hearing
I have been pointing out how
I have been profoundly moved
I have been requested to say a word
I have been told by an eminent authority
I have been too long accustomed to hear
I have been touched by the large generosity
I have been trying to show
I have before me the statistics
I have but one more word to add
I have demonstrated to you
I have depicted
I have endeavored to emphasize
I have enlarged on this subject
I have felt it almost a duty to
I have found great cause for wonder
I have frequently been surprised at
I have gazed with admiration
I have generally observed
I have gone so far as to suggest
I have good reason for
I have had steadily in mind
I have had the honor
I have had to take a long sweep
I have heard it objected
I have heard with relief and pleasure
I have hitherto been adducing instances 
I have hitherto been engaged in showing
I have in a measure anticipated
I have in my possession
I have incidentally dwelt on
I have introduced it to suggest
I have labored to maintain
I have laid much stress upon
I have lately observed many strong indications
I have listened with the utmost interest
I have little hope that I can add anything
I have lived to see
I have long ago insisted
I have long been of the conviction
I have never heard it suggested
I have never whispered a syllable
I have no acquaintance with
I have no doubt whatever
I have no excuse for intruding
I have no fear of myself
I have no fears for the success
I have no hesitation in asserting
I have no intention to moralize
I have no particular inclination
I have no prejudice on the subject
I have no pretention to be regarded
I have no reason to think
I have no scruple in saying
I have no such gloomy forebodings
I have no sympathy with the men
I have no thought of venturing to say
I have no wish at all to preach
I have not accustomed myself
I have not allowed myself
I have not been able to deny
I have not particularly referred to
I have not said anything yet
I have not the means of forming a judgment
I have not the right to reproach
I have not time to present
I have nothing more to say
I have noticed of late years
I have now explained to you
I have now made bold to touch upon
I have now rather more than kept my word
I have now said all that occurs to me
I have often been impressed with
I have often been struck with the resemblance
I have often lingered in fancy
I have one step farther to go
I have only partially examined
I have partly anticipated
I have pleasant memories of
I have pointed out
I have pride and pleasure in quoting
I have racked this brain of mine
I have read with great regret
I have said and I repeat
I have said over and over again
I have said what I solemnly believe
I have scant patience
I have seen for myself
I have seen it stated in a recent journal
I have seen some signs of encouragement
I have shown
I have some sort of fear
I have sometimes asked myself
I have sometimes fancied
I have sometimes wondered whether
I have still two comments to make
I have taken pains to know
I have the confident hope
I have the greatest possible confidence
I have the honor to propose
I have then to investigate
I have thought it incumbent on me
I have thought it right on this day
I have thought it well to suggest
I have throughout highly appreciated
I have thus been led by my feelings
I have thus stated the reason
I have to confess with a feeling of melancholy
I have to force my imagination
I have touched very cursorily
I have tried to convey to you
I have undertaken to speak
I have very much less feeling of
I have watched with some attention
I have witnessed the extraordinary
I have yet a more cogent reason
I have yet to learn
I hazard nothing in saying
I hear it sometimes said
I hear you say to yourselves
I heartily feel the singular claims
I hesitate to take an instance
I hold it to be clearly expedient
I hold myself obliged to
I hold the maxim no less applicable
I hold this to be a truth
I hold to the principle
I hope by this time we are all convinced
I hope for our own sakes
I hope I have expressed myself explicitly
I hope I may be allowed to intimate
I hope I shall not be told
I hope it is no disparagement
I hope most sincerely and truly
I hope none who hear me
I hope not to occupy more than a few minutes
I hope that I shall not be so unfortunate
I hope the day may be far distant
I hope the time may come again
I hope to be excused if
I hope to be forgiven if
I hope we may forget
I hope you will not accuse me
I imagine that no one will be disposed
I insist upon it
I intend to propose
I know from experience how
I know full well
I know I am treading on thin ice
I know it has been questioned
I know it is said
I know it will be said
I know many reasons why
I know not how else to express
I know not in what direction to look
I know not of my own knowledge
I know not where else to find
I know perfectly well
I know that it is impossible for me to
I know that this is the feeling
I know that what I may say is true
I know there are some who think
I know there is a theory among us
I know too well
I know very well the difference between
I know well it is not for me
I know well the sentiments
I know you are all impatient to hear
I know you will do all in your power
I know you will interpret what I say
I labor under a degree of prejudice
I lately heard it affirmed
I lay it down as a principle
I leave history to judge
I leave it to you
I leave the arduous task
I leave to others to speak
I long to speak a word or two
I look hopefully to
I look in vain
I look with encouragement
I look with inexpressible dread
I look with mingled hope and terror
I make my appeal to
I make no extravagant claim
I make this abrupt acknowledgment
I marvel that
I may add, speaking for my own part
I may be allowed to make one remark
I may be permitted to add
I may confess to you
I may safely appeal
I may say to you calmly
I may seem to have been diffuse
I may take as an instance
I may venture upon a review
I mean by this
I mean something more than that
I mean, moreover
I mention it to you to justify
I mention these facts because
I mention this, not by way of complaint
I might bring you another such case
I might deny that
I might enter into such detail
I might go further
I might go on indefinitely
I might go on to illustrate
I might of course point first
I might reasonably question the justice
I might try to explain
I might venture to claim
I might well have desired
I might well think
I must ask an abrupt question
I must be careful about what I say
I must be contented with
I must be excused if I say
I must bow in reverence
I must call your attention for a moment
I must conclude abruptly
I must confess that I became rather alarmed
I must consider this as
I must crave your indulgence
I must express to you again
I must fairly tell you
I must find some fault with
I must for want of time omit
I must here admit
I must lament
I must leave any detailed development
I must mention with praise
I must not allow myself to indulge
I must not for an instant be supposed
I must not overlook
I must now beg to ask
I must pause a moment to
I must proceed
I must qualify the statement
I must remind my hearers of
I must reply to some observations
I must return to the subject
I must say that I am one of those
I must speak plainly
I must suppose, however
I must take occasion to say
I must thank you once more
I must try to describe to you
I myself have boundless faith
I need not assure this brilliant company
I need not dwell
I need not enter into
I need not follow out the application
I need not say how much I thank you
I need not show how inconsistent
I need not specially recommend to you
I need not wander far in search
I need not, I am certain, assure you
I need only to observe
I need say nothing in praise
I need scarcely observe
I need to guard myself right here
I neither affirm nor deny
I next come to the implicit assumption
I note with particular pleasure
I notice it as affording an instance
I noticed incidentally the fact
I now address you on a question
I now come, sir, to the second head
I now have the pleasure of presenting to you
I now pass to the question of
I now proceed to inquire
I now reiterate
I object strongly to the use
I observe, then, in the first place
I only ask a favorable construction of
I only marvel
I only wish you to recognize
I open the all-important question
I ought to give an illustration
I own I can not help feeling
I particularly allude to
I pass on from that
I pass then to our second division
I pause for a moment to say
I pause to confess once more
I pay tribute to
I personally know that it is so
I pray God I may never
I predict that you will
I prefer a practical view
I presume I shall have to admit
I presume that I shall not be disbelieved
I proceed to another important phase
I profess
I propose briefly to glance at
I propose, therefore to consider
I protest I never had any doubt
I purposely have avoided
I question whether
I quite endorse what has been said
I rather look forward to a time
I readily grant
I really can not think it necessary to
I really do not know
I really thought that you would excuse me
I recall another historical fact
I recognize the high compliment conveyed
I recollect hearing a sagacious remark 
I refer especially
I refuse to believe
I regard as an erroneous view
I regard it as a tribute
I regard it as a very great honor
I regret that I am not able to remember
I regret that it is not possible for me
I regret the time limits me
I regret this the less
I rejoice in an occasion like this
I rejoice that events have occurred
I rejoice to think I remark here
I remember a reference made
I remember an intimation
I remember full well
I remember the enjoyment with which
I remember to have heard
I repeat my statement in another form
I repeat, I am not speaking
I respectfully counsel
I respectfully submit
I rest my opinion on
I return you my most grateful thanks
I return, in conclusion, to
I rise in behalf
I rise to express my disapprobation 
I rise to thank you
I rise with some trepidation
I said a little way back
I said it would be well
I said that I thought
I salute with profound reverence
I sanction with all my heart
I saw an ingenious argument the other day
I say frankly
I say in moderation
I say it is extremely important
I say it most confidently
I say no more of these things
I say not one syllable against
I say this is no disparagement of
I say this the more gladly
I say without fear of contradiction
I say, then, my first point is
I see around me
I see as clearly as any man possibly can
I see little hope of
I see no exception
I see no possibility of
I see no reason for doubting
I seem to hear you say
I seize upon this opportunity
I seriously desire
I set out with saying
I shall add a few words
I shall address myself to a single point
I shall ask you to look very closely
I shall be told
I shall best attain my object
I shall bestow a little attention upon
I shall certainly admit
I shall consider myself privileged
I shall desist from
I shall endeavor to be guided
I shall give it in the words of
I shall here briefly recite the
I shall here use the word to denote
I shall hope to interest you
I shall invite you to follow me
I shall just give the summary of
I shall never believe
I shall never cease to be grateful
I shall not acknowledge
I shall not attempt a detailed narrative
I shall not end without appealing
I shall not enlarge upon
I shall not force into the discussion
I shall not go so far as to say
I shall not hesitate to say something
I shall not tax your patience
I shall not undertake to prophesy
I shall not weary your patience
I shall now give you some instances
I shall now proceed to show
I shall often have to advert to
I shall pass by all this
I shall presently show
I shall proceed without further preface
I shall recur to certain questions
I shall say all this without entering into
I shall show that I am not
I shall speak first about
I shall speak with becoming frankness
I shall take a broader view of the subject
I shall take it for granted here
I shall therefore endeavor
I shall touch upon one or two questions
I shall waste no time in refuting
I shall with your sanction
I should be false to my own manhood
I should be surprised if
I should be the last man to deny
I should fail in my duty if
I should find it hard to discover
I should have forfeited my own self-respect
I should like at least to mention
I should like to emphasize
I should like to go a step farther
I should like to refer to two events
I should like to see that view answered
I should like to-day to examine briefly
I should much prefer
I should not be satisfied with myself
I should think it too absurd
I shrink from the contemplation
I shudder at the doctrine
I simply lay my finger on a fact
I simply pause here to ask
I sincerely regret the absence
I sincerely wish it were in my power
I solemnly declare
I sometimes hear a wish expressed
I sorrowfully call to mind
I speak forth my sentiment
I speak from no little personal observation
I speak of this to show
I speak the fact when I tell you
I speak the secret feeling of this company
I speak what I know when I say
I speak wholly without authority
I speak with feeling upon this point
I speak with some degree of encouragement
I speak with the utmost sincerity
I speak within the hearing of
I stand in awed amazement before
I stand in the midst of men
I still view with respect
I submit it to every candid mind
I submit that in such a case
I submit that it is high time
I submit this proposition
I summon you to do your share
I suppose it is right to answer
I suppose it to be entirely true
I suppose most men will recollect
I suppose that everyone who listens to me
I suppose there is no one here
I suppose we are all of one opinion
I suspect that is why we so often
I sympathize most heartily
I take a broader and bolder position
I take it for granted
I take leave to say
I take one picture as an illustration
I take pleasure in saying
I take the liberty of observing
I take this instance at random
I take two views of
I tell him in reply
I tell you, gentlemen
I tender my thanks to you
I thank you for having allowed me
I thank you for the appreciative tone
I thank you for the honor
I thank you for your most generous greeting
I thank you for your thoughtful courtesy
I thank you from the bottom of my heart
I thank you very gratefully
I thank you very sincerely for the honor
I think I am correct in saying
I think I am not the first to utter
I think I can claim a purpose
I think I can sincerely declare
I think I have a right to look upon
I think I have rightly spoken
I think I might safely say
I think I need not say more
I think it is not too much to say
I think it is quite right
I think it may be necessary to consider
I think it might be said with safety
I think it my duty to
I think it observable
I think it probable
I think it will astonish you
I think it will be granted
I think no Wise man can be indifferent
I think something may be said in favor of
I think that all will agree
I think that I can explain
I think that I can venture to say
I think that none of us will deny
I think that, in these last years
I think there is no better evidence
I think there is no call on me to listen
I think we are justified
I think we can hardly hope
I think we may all easily see
I think we may ask in reply
I think we may safely conclude
I think we may say, therefore
I think we may well be proud of
I think we may well congratulate each other
I think we must draw a distinction
I think we need neither doubt nor fear
I think we ought to recur a moment to
I think we shall all recognize
I think we should do well to call to mind
I think we take too narrow a view
I think when we look back upon
I think you may well rejoice in
I think you will all agree
I think you will pardon my saying
I think you will see
I think, on the contrary
I thus explicitly reply
I tremble at the task
I tremble to think
I trust I may be indulged
I trust it is not presumptuous
I trust that as the years roll on
I trust that I shall have the indulgence
I trust that this will not be regarded as
I turn, gentlemen, to the case
I use the word advisedly
I use the word in the sense
I use very plain language
I utter this word with the deepest affection
I value very much the honor
I venture to ask permission
I venture to say
I verily believe
I very confidently submit
I view that prospect with the greatest misgiving
I want to bespeak your attention
I want to know the character
I want to make some simple applications
I want to say just a few words
I want to say one word more
I want to say to you seriously
I want to think with you
I warn and exhort you
I was astonished to learn
I was constantly watchful to
I was exceedingly interested
I was honored with the acquaintance
I was lost in admiration
I was not slow to accept and believe
I was not without some anxiety
I was overwhelmed
I was sincerely astonished
I was very much interested
I was very much thrilled
I well recollect the time
I well remember an occasion
I will accept the general proposition
I will add the memorable words
I will ask the indulgence
I will ask you to accompany me
I will ask you to bear witness
I will dwell a little longer
I will endeavor in a brief way
I will endeavor to illustrate
I will endeavor to show you
I will enlarge no further
I will even express a hope at the outset
I will even go further and say
I will first call your attention to
I will give one more illustration
I will illustrate this point by
I will merely mention
I will neither affirm nor deny
I will not allude
I will not argue this
I will not attempt to note
I will not be content until
I will not condescend to
I will not enumerate at present
I will not pause to maintain
I will not positively say
I will not pretend to inquire into
I will not quarrel with
I will not relinquish the confidence
I will not repeat the arguments here
I will not try to gauge
I will now consider with you
I will now leave this question
I will now take an instance
I will only speak to one point
I will only sum up my evidence
I will only take an occasion to express
I will only venture to remind you
I will point out to your attention
I will say at once
I will speak but a word or two more
I will speak plainly
I will state with perfect distinctness
I will suppose the objection to be
I will take one more instance
I will take the precaution to add
I will tell you what I think of
I will try to make the thing intelligible
I will venture a single remark
I will venture to add
I will venture to express the hope
I will yield the whole question
I willingly admit
I wish also to declare positively
I wish at the outset
I wish emphatically to reaffirm
I wish I had the time and the power
I wish it first observed
I wish rather to call your attention
I wish to ask if you honestly and candidly believe
I wish to be allowed to enforce in detail
I wish to begin my statement
I wish to confine what I have to say
I wish to do full justice to
I wish to draw your attention
I wish to express my profound gratification
I wish to give these arguments their full weight
I wish to know whether
I wish to offer a few words relative to
I wish to remind you in how large a degree
I wish to say a word or two
I wish to state all this as a matter of fact
I wish you success and happiness
I wish you to observe
I wish, sir, that justice might be done
I would also gratefully acknowledge
I would as soon believe
I would desire to speak simply and directly
I would enter a protest
I would further point out to you
I would have you understand
I would infinitely rather
I would like to say one word just here
I would not be understood as belittling
I would not dwell upon that matter if
I would not push the suggestion so far
I would now gladly lay before you
I would rather a thousand times
I would recommend to your consideration
I would suggest first of all
I would that my voice could reach the ear
I would urge and entreat you
I would urge upon you
I would venture to point out
I yielded to the earnest solicitations
I, for my part, would rather
I, for one, greatly doubt
If any man be so persuaded
If any other answer be made
If anyone could conceive
If anyone is so dim of vision
If at first view this should seem
If I am asked for the proof
If I am wrong
If I can carry you with me
If I can succeed in describing
If I could find words
If I have done no more than view the facts
If I have in any way deserved
If I may be allowed a little criticism
If I may be allowed modestly to suggest
If I may be allowed to refer
If I may reverently say so
If I may say so without presumption
If I may so speak
If I may take for granted
If I may venture to say anything
If I mistake not the sentiment
If I recollect aright
If I understand the matter at all
If I venture a few remarks
If I were asked
If I were to act upon my conviction
If I were to recapitulate
If I wished to prove my contention
If in the glow of conscious pride
If in the years of the future
If it be difficult to appreciate
If it be so
If it be true
If it is contended
If it means anything, it means this
If more were needed to illustrate.
If my opinions are true
If on the contrary, we all foresee
If one seeks to measure
If only we go deep enough
If still you have further doubt
If the bare facts were studied
If the experience of the world is worth anything
If there be any among us
If there be one lesson more than another
If this be so
If this seems doubtful to anyone
If we accept at all the argument
If we are not blind to
If we are rightly informed
If we are to reason on the fact
If we cast our glance back
If we embark upon a career
If we had the whole case before us
If we isolate ourselves
If we may trust to experience
If we pursue a different course
If we pursue our inquiries through
If we sincerely desire
If we survey
If we would not be beguiled
If what has been said is true
If you remain silent
If you seek the real meaning of
If you think for a moment
If you want to look
If you were asked to point out
If you will allow me to prophesy
If you will forgive me the expression
If you wish for a more interesting example
If you wish to get at the bottom of facts
If you would see the most conclusive proof
If your view is right
If, however, you determine to
If, in consequence we find it necessary
If, on the other hand, I say
If, then, I am asked
If, then, I should here rest my cause
If, unhappily, the day should ever come
In a significant paragraph
In a wider sense
In a word, gentlemen
In a word, I conceive
In actual life, I suspect
In addition to these arguments
In addressing myself to the question
In addressing you I feel
In agreement with this obvious conclusion
In all ages of the world
In all or any of these views
In all times and places
In an unguarded moment
In answering the inquiry
In any view of the case
In closing my speech, I ask each of you
In conclusion, let me say
In conclusion, may I repeat
In consequence it becomes a necessity
In contemplating the causes
In days to come
In examining this part of the subject
In fine, it is no extravagance to say
In former ages and generations
In further illustration
In further proof of my assertion
In illustration of what I have said
In like manner are to be explained
In like manner I would advise
In listening to the kind words
In looking about me
In many instances
In meeting this difficulty, I will not urge
In most cases I hold
In my estimation
In my humble opinion
In my view
In offering to you these counsels
In one other respect
In one point I wish no one to mistake me
In one sense this is undoubtedly true
In order to appreciate the force of
In order to complete the proof
In order to do justice to the question
In order to prove plainly and intelligibly
In order to realize adequately
In other words
In our estimate of the past
In point of fact
In precisely the same way
In pursuance of these views
In pursuing the great objects
In regard to
In rising to return my sincere thanks
In saying all of this, I do not forget
In saying this, I am not disposed to deny
In short, I say
In solving this difficulty
In something of a parallel way
In spite of the fact
In such cases, strictly speaking
In support of this assertion
In that matchless epitome
In that mood of high hope
In the anomalies of fortune
In the course of these remarks
In the existing circumstances
In the first place we see
In the first place, therefore, I consider
In the first place, we should be all agreed
In the fullest sense
In the fullness of time
In the last suggestion
In the meantime I will commend to you
In the next place, be assured
In the presence of this vast assembly
In the present situation
In the progress of events
In the remarks I have made
In the same manner I rely
In the second place it is quite clear
In the suggestion I have made
In the very brief space at our disposal
In these extraordinary circumstances
In these sentiments I agree
In this brief survey
In this connection I remind myself
In this connection, I may be permitted to refer
In this necessarily brief and imperfect review
In this rapid and slight enumeration
In this respect
In this sense only
In this there is no contradiction
In very many instances
In very truth
In view of these reflections
In what has now been said
In what I have now further to say
In widening our view
Indeed we know
Indeed, can anyone tell me
Indeed, I am not convinced
Indeed, I can not do better
Indeed, I have heard it whispered
Indeed, I may fairly say
Indeed, it will generally be found
Instances abound
Is it logically consistent
Is it not legitimate to recognize
Is it not marvelous
Is it not obvious
Is it not quite possible
Is it not universally recognized
Is it not wise to argue
Is it not, then, preposterous
Is it possible, can it be believed
Is it, then, any wonder
Is not that the common sentiment
Is there any evidence here
Is there any language of reproach
Is there any possibility of mistaking
Is there any reason in the world
It affords me gratification
It also pleases me very much
It amounts to this
It appears from what has been said
It appears to me, on the contrary
It can rightly be said
It certainly follows, then
It comes to this
It could not be otherwise
It does not necessarily follow
It exhibits a state of mind
It follows as a matter of course
It follows inevitably
It gives us an exalted conception
It grieves me to relate
It hardly fits the character
It has at all times been a just reproach
It has been a very great pleasure for me
It has been generally assumed
It has been justly objected
It has been my privilege
It has been suggested fancifully
It has been well said
It has ever been my ambition
It has struck me very forcibly
It is a circumstance of happy augury 
It is a common error
It is a curious trait
It is a fact well known
It is a falsehood to say
It is a familiar charge against
It is a good augury of success 
It is a great pleasure to me
It is a living truth
It is a matter of absorbing interest
It is a matter of amusement
It is a matter of fact
It is a matter of just pride
It is a melancholy story
It is a memory I cherish
It is a mischievous notion
It is a mistake to suppose
It is a most extraordinary thing
It is a most pertinent question
It is a noble thing
It is a peculiar pleasure to me
It is a perversion of terms
It is a pleasing peculiarity
It is a popular idea
It is a rare privilege
It is a recognized principle
It is a remarkable and striking fact
It is a strange fact
It is a sure sign
It is a theme too familiar
It is a thing commonly said
It is a touching reflection
It is a true saying
It is a very significant fact
It is a vision which still inspires us
It is a wholesome symptom
It is all very fine to think
It is all very well to say
It is almost proverbial
It is also possible
It is also probably true
It is always pleasant to respond
It is amazing how little
It is an easy matter
It is an egregious mistake 
It is an established rule
It is an incredible thing
It is an interesting fact
It is an unforgivable offense
It is an unquestionable truth
It is appropriate that we should celebrate
It is asserted
It is assumed as an axiom
It is at once inconsistent
It is but fair to say
It is but too true
It is by no means my design
It is certainly especially pleasant
It is certainly remarkable
It is common in these days to lament
It is commonly assumed
It is comparatively easy
It is curious sophistry
It is curious to observe
It is desirable for us
It is difficult for me to respond fitly
It is difficult to avoid saying
It is difficult to describe
It is difficult to overstate
It is difficult to put a limit
It is difficult to surmise
It is doubtful whether
It is easy enough to add
It is easy to instance cases
It is easy to understand
It is eminently proper
It is every man's duty to think
It is evident that the answer to this
It is evidently supposed by many people
It is exceedingly gratifying to hear
It is exceedingly unfortunate
It is fair that you should hear
It is fair to suppose
It is far from me to desire
It is fatal to suppose
It is fitting
It is for me to relate
It is for others to illustrate
It is for this reason
It is for us to ask
It is gratifying to have the honor
It is greatly assumed
It is hardly for me
It is hardly necessary to pass judgment
It is idle to think of
It is immaterial whether
It is impossible to avoid saying
It is in every way appropriate
It is in the highest degree worthy
It is in this characteristic
It is in vain
It is in your power to give
It is indeed a strange doctrine
It is indeed not a little remarkable
It is indeed true
It is indeed very clear
It is indispensable to have
It is interesting and suggestive
It is interesting to know
It is just so far true
It is likewise necessary
It is made evident
It is manifest
It is manifestly absurd to say
It is merely common sense to say
It is more than probable
It is my agreeable duty
It is my belief
It is my earnest wish
It is my grateful duty to address you
It is my hope
It is my present purpose
It is natural to ask the question
It is necessary to refer
It is necessary to take some notice
It is needful to a complete understanding
It is needless before this audience to repeat
It is no doubt true
It is no exaggeration to say
It is no part of my business
It is no significant thing
It is no small indication
It is no wonder
It is not a practical question
It is not altogether satisfactory
It is not an unknown occurrence
It is not by any means
It is not difficult to comprehend
It is not difficult to discern
It is not easy for me to find words
It is not enough to say
It is not entirely clear to me
It is not evident
It is not for me on this occasion
It is not given to many men
It is not likely that any of you
It is not logical to say
It is not my intention to enter into
It is not my purpose to discuss
It is not necessarily true
It is not necessary for me even to sketch
It is not necessary for our purpose
It is not often in these modern days
It is not ours to pronounce
It is not out of place to remind you
It is not possible to recount
It is not quite clear
It is not to me so very surprising
It is not too much to say
It is not unknown to you
It is not within the scope of this address
It is now high time for me
It is now perfectly plain
It is observable enough
It is obvious
It is of course difficult
It is of great importance to show
It is of no moment
It is of very little importance
It is often remarked
It is on these grounds
It is one of the burning questions of the day
It is one of the most natural visions
It is one of the most significant things
It is one of the queerest freaks of fate
It is only a few short years since
It is only just to say
It is our duty to examine
It is ours to bear witness
It is owing to this truth
It is peculiarly befitting at this time
It is perfectly apparent
It is pitiable to reflect
It is pleasant to meet this brilliant company
It is rather a pleasant coincidence
It is rather an arduous task
It is rather startling
It is related
It is ridiculous to say
It is said to be impossible
It is said, and I think said truly
It is satisfactory to notice
It is scarcely necessary to insist
It is scarcely questioned
It is self-evident
It is sometimes hard to determine
It is still an open question
It is still more surprising
It is substantially true
It is surely necessary for me
It is the clear duty of
It is the doctrine of
It is the fashion to extol
It is the universal testimony
It is therefore evident
It is therefore necessary
It is this which lies at the foundation
It is to be expected
It is to be remembered
It is to me a very sincere satisfaction
It is told traditionally
It is too plain to be argued
It is true
It is unnecessary for me to remind you
It is upon this line of reasoning
It is very common to confuse
It is very doubtful whether
It is very interesting and pleasant
It is well known
It is with great pleasure
It is with pity unspeakable
It is within the memory of men now living
It is worth while to notice
It is, all things considered, a fact
It may appear absurd
It may at first sight seem strange
It may be added
It may be conjectured
It may be imagined
It may be plausibly objected
It may be rightly said
It may be useful to trace
It may be worth your while to keep in view
It may indeed be unavoidable
It may not be altogether certain
It may not be uninteresting to any of you
It may or may not be true
It may seem a little strange
It may still more probably be said
It may, perhaps, seem wonderful
It must be a cause of delight
It must be borne in mind
It must be the verdict of history
It must create astonishment
It must doubtless be admitted
It must ever be recollected
It must never be forgotten
It must not be supposed
It must seem to every thoughtful man
It needs scarcely be said
It now becomes my pride and privilege
It only remains now to speak
It ought to animate us
It proves a great deal
It remains only to speak briefly
It remains that I inform you of
It remains that I should say a few words
It reminds me of an anecdote
It reminds one of the compliment
It requires no effort of imagination
It scarcely seems to be in keeping
It seems almost desperate to think of
It seems almost incredible
It seems now to be generally admitted
It seems strange to be told
It seems then that on the whole
It seems to me a striking circumstance
It seems to me idle to ask
It seems to me singularly appropriate
It seems to me the primary foundation
It seems to me unphilosophical
It should always be borne in mind
It should be remembered
It so happens
It sometimes seems to me
It still remains to be observed
It strikes me with wonder
It suggests at the outset
It summons our imagination
It surely is not too much to expect
It therefore astonishes me
It used to be a reproach
It was a brilliant answer
It was a fine and delicate rebuke
It was a fit and beautiful circumstance
It was a propitious circumstance 
It was certainly a gracious act
It was in the full understanding
It was my good fortune
It was not to be expected
It was said by one who ought to know
It was under these circumstances
It was, therefore, inevitable
It will appeal to
It will appear from what has been said
It will be asked me how
It will be easy to say too much
It will be easy to trace the influence
It will be evident to you
It will be idle to imply
It will be interesting to trace
It will be just as reasonable to say
It will be rather to our advantage
It will be recollected
It will be seen at a glance
It will be well and wise
It will carry out my meaning more fully
It will not be expected from me
It will not be safe
It will not do for a man to say
It will not surely be objected
It will not take many words to sum up
It will not, I trust, be concluded
It will thus be seen
It will, I suppose, be denied
It would be a misfortune
It would be a proud distinction
It would be a very remarkable fact
It would be absurd to pretend
It would be an inexcusable omission
It would be idle for me
It would be imprudent in me
It would be invidious for me 
It would be natural on such an occasion
It would be no less impracticable
It would be out of place here
It would be preposterous to say
It would be presumptuous in me
It would be the height of absurdity
It would be unfair to praise
It would be unjust to deny
It would be well for us to reflect
It would indeed be unworthy
It would seem perhaps most fitting
Just the reverse is true
Language is inadequate to voice my appreciation
Lastly, I do not understand
Lastly, it can not be denied
Less than this could not be said
Lest I should be accused of quibbling
Let all of us labor in this work
Let anyone imagine to himself
Let anyone who doubts
Let everyone consider
Let it be clearly understood, I repeat it
Let it be remembered
Let it not be objected
Let it not be supposed that I impute 
Let me add another thing
Let me add my final word
Let me add one other hint
Let me also say a word in regard
Let me answer these questions
Let me ask you to imagine
Let me ask your leave to propose
Let me be allowed to devote a few words
Let me call attention to another fact
Let me commend to you
Let me direct your attention now to
Let me entreat you to examine
Let me give one more instance
Let me give one parting word
Let me give you an illustration
Let me here make one remark
Let me here say
Let me hope that I have said enough
Let me illustrate again
Let me make myself distinctly understood
Let me make use of an illustration
Let me not be thought offensive
Let me now conclude with
Let me once more urge upon you
Let me protest against the manner
Let me quite temperately defend
Let me rather make the supposition
Let me say a practical word
Let me simply declare
Let me tell you an interesting reminiscence
Let me thank you once more
Let me urge you earnestly
Let no man congratulate himself
Let our conception be enlarged
Let our object be
Let that question be answered by
Let the facts be granted
Let these instances suffice
Let this be the record made
Let this inspire us with abhorrence of
Let us approach the subject from another side
Let us attempt a survey
Let us be perfectly just
Let us be quite practical
Let us bear perpetually in mind
Let us begin at the beginning
Let us begin by examining
Let us briefly review
Let us brush aside once for all
Let us cherish
Let us confirm our opinion
Let us consider for a moment
Let us devote ourselves
Let us discard all prejudice
Let us do all we can
Let us draw an illustration
Let us endeavor to understand
Let us enumerate
Let us figure to ourselves
Let us for the moment put aside
Let us get a clear understanding
Let us heed the voice
Let us hope and believe
Let us hope that future generations
Let us imitate
Let us inquire also
Let us labor and pray
Let us likewise remember
Let us look briefly at a few particulars
Let us look nearer home
Let us not be fearful
Let us not be misled
Let us not be misunderstood
Let us not flatter ourselves
Let us not for a moment forget
Let us not limit our view
Let us now apply the views presented
Let us now consider the characteristics
Let us now see the results
Let us now turn our consideration
Let us observe this analogy
Let us pass on to another fact
Let us pause a moment
Let us push the inquiry yet further
Let us rather listen to
Let us reflect how vain
Let us remember this
Let us remind ourselves
Let us resolve
Let us scrutinize the facts
Let us suppose the case to be
Let us suppose, for argument's sake
Let us take, for instance
Let us try to form a mental picture
Let us turn to the contemplation of
Let us, then, be assured
Let us, then, be worthy of
Let us, therefore, say once for all
Let your imagination realize
Like all citizens of high ideals
Likely enough
Little wonder therefore
Long have I been convinced
Look at it in another way
Look at some of these questions
Look at the situation
Mainly, I believe
Making allowances for differences of opinion
Many of us have had the good fortune
Many of you, perhaps, recollect
May I ask you to believe
May I not speak here
May I try to show that every effort
May I venture to suggest
May it not also be advanced
May the day come quickly
Meantime it is encouraging to think
Meanwhile let us freely recognize
Men are in the habit of saying
Men are telling us nowadays
Men everywhere testify
More and more it is felt
More than once have I had to express
More than this need not be said
Moreover, I have insisted
Moreover, I would counsel you
Moreover, when we pass judgment
Much has been said and written about
My appreciation has been quickened
My belief, therefore, is
My duty is to endeavor to show
My experience tells me
My first duty is to express to you
My friends, do you really believe
My friends, I propose
My heart tells me
My idea, therefore, is
My last criticism upon
My mind is not moved by
My mind most perfectly acquiesces
My next objection is
My own private opinion is
My present business is
My regret is intensified by the thought
Nay, I boldly say
Nay, it will be a relief to my mind
Nay, there is a general feeling
Need I say that I mean
Neither should you deceive
Never before have I so strongly felt
Never can I cease to feel
Never did there devolve
Never for a moment believe
Never have I felt so forcibly
Never was a weaker defense attempted
Never was there a greater mistake
Never was there an instance
Nevertheless we can admit
Next, from what has been said it is plain
Next, I consider
Next, it will be denied
No argument can overwhelm a fact
No defense is to be found
No distinct test can be named
No doubt there are many questions
No doubt to most of us
No doubt, in the first instance
No finer sentence has come down to us
No greater service could be rendered
No longer do we believe
No man regrets more than I do
No one can feel this more strongly
No one can see the end
No one can, I think, pretend
No one here, I am sure
No one need to exaggerate
No one will accuse me
No one, I suppose, would say
No one, I think, can fail to observe
No one, I think, will dispute the statement
No true man ever believes
None can have failed to observe
Nor am I disparaging or discouraging
Nor can I forget either
Nor can it justly be said
Nor can we afford to waste time
Nor can we forget how long
Nor can we now ask
Nor do I believe
Nor do I doubt
Nor do I pretend
Nor do I think there can be found
Nor does it matter much
Nor has there been wanting
Nor indeed am I supposing
Nor is it a fair objection
Nor is it probable
Nor is this all
Nor let me forget to add here
Nor must I be understood as saying
Nor must it be forgotten
Nor need we fear to speak
Nor should any attempt be made
Nor will history fail to record
Nor will I enlarge on the matter
Not at all
Not only so
Not that I quarrel with
Nothing but the deepest sense
Nothing can be further from the truth
Nothing could be clearer
Nothing could be more striking
Nothing is more common in the world
Nothing that you can do
Notwithstanding all that has been said
Notwithstanding all this, I hold
Now comes the question
Now, bear with me when I say
Now, comparing these instances together
Now, from these instances it is plain
Now, having spoken of
Now, I admit
Now, I am far from denying
Now, I am far from undervaluing
Now, I am justified in calling this
Now, I am obliged to say
Now, I do not wish you to believe
Now, I have a closing sentence or two
Now, I pass on to consider
Now, I shall not occupy your time
Now, I understand the argument
Now, I will undertake to say
Now, I wish to call your attention
Now, if you will clearly understand
Now, is there any ground or basis for
Now, it is an undoubted fact
Now, it is evident
Now, it is not at all strange
Now, it is unquestioned
Now, let me speak with the greatest care
Now, let me stop a moment
Now, let us consider
Now, observe, my drift
Now, sir, I am truly horrified
Now, the answer we should give
Now, the question here at issue
Now, the world will say
Now, there is a close alliance between
Now, this is precisely the danger
Now, this is to some extent
Now, understand me definitely
Now, we do not maintain
Now, we will inquire
Now, what I want you to realize
Now, with regard to
Now, you will allow me to state
Now, you will understand from this
Observe again
Occasionally you ought to read
Of course I am aware
Of course I am putting an impossible case
Of course I can not be taken to mean
Of course I do not maintain
Of course I do not stop here
Of course I would not allow
Of course much may be said
Of course these remarks hold good
Of course we may, if we please
Of course you will sympathize
Of one thing, however, I am certain
Of this briefly
Of this statement I will only say
Of this truth I shall convince you by
On a review of the whole subject
On occasions of this kind
On such a day as this
On the contrary, I am assuming
On the occasion to which I refer
On the other hand, it is clear
On the whole, then, I observe
On this auspicious occasion
On this point I do not mean to dwell
On this subject you need not suspect
Once again, there are those
Once more I emphasize
Once more let me try to put into words
One additional remark
One almost wishes
One can not decline to note
One concluding remark has to be made
One fact is clear and indisputable
One further word
One important topic remains
One is fairly tempted to wish
One lesson history may be said to repeat
One might be challenged to produce
One of the ancients said
One of the most commonly known
One of the most extraordinary incidents
One of the things I recollect with most pride
One of these signs is the fact
One or two points are made clear
One other circumstance
One other remark suggests itself
One remark I will make
One thing more will complete this question
One thing which always impressed me
One very striking tendency
One word in courtesy I must say
One word more in a serious vein
One would naturally suppose
Only so much do I know
Opinions are divided as to whether
Or to come nearer home
Or to take but one other example
Ordinarily speaking, such deductions
Others may hold other opinions
Ought we not to think
Our thoughts wander back
Over and above all this
Pardon me if
Perhaps another reason why
Perhaps I may be best able to illustrate
Perhaps I ought to say
Perhaps it may be doubted
Perhaps, however, in speaking to you
Perhaps, however, some among you will be
Perhaps, sir, I am mistaken in
Permit me frankly to say
Permit me to add another circumstance
Permit me to bring home to you
Personally, I am far too firm a believer
Pray, sir, let me say
Read but your history aright
Recollect, sir
Reflections such as these
Rely upon it
Remember, I do not seek to
Remembering some past occurrences
Returning, then, to the consideration
Seriously, then, do I beg you
Shall I tell you
Shall we complain
Should there be objection, I answer
Since, then, it is provided
Since, then, this is the case
Sir, with all my heart, I respond
So accustomed are we
So at least it seems to me
So far as I know
So far as my observation and experience goes
So far in general
So I say to you
So it comes to pass
So long as we continue to love truth and duty
So men are asking
So much at first sight
So much on this subject
So that I may venture to say
So that if you were persuaded
So then ought we also
So when I hear people say
So, to add one other example
So, too, I may go on to speak
Some have insisted
Some of you can recall the time
Some of you may think this visionary
Some of you will remember
Some one will perhaps object
Some prejudice is attached
Some writer has said
Sometimes I venture to think
Sometimes it may happen
Speaking in this place
Startling as this may appear to you
Stating only the truth, I affirm
Still another encouraging fact
Still further
Still I can not part from my subject
Still I have generally found
Still I imagine you would consider it
Still I know what answer I can make to
Still it may with justice be said
Still one thing more
Still we ought to be grateful
Strange as it may seem
Strictly in confidence, I do not think
Strictly speaking, there is no such thing
Such a doctrine is essentially superficial
Such are the rather tolerant ideas
Such considerations as these
Such illustrations are not frequent
Such is steadfastly my opinion
Such is the deep prejudice now existing
Such is the intellectual view we take
Such is the lesson which I am taught
Such is the progress
Such is the truth
Such, I believe, would be the consequences
Such, in brief, is the story
Such, sir, I conceive to be
Such, then, is the true idea
Such, too, is the characteristic of
Suffer me to point out
Suffice it to say here
Summing up what I have said
Suppose we turn our eyes to
Surely I do not misinterpret
Surely it is a paradox
Surely it is not too much for me to say
Take another instance
Take one of the most recent cases
Take the simple fact
Take this example
Taking a broader view
Taking the facts by themselves
That is a further point
That is a natural boast
That is a pure assumption
That is all that it seems necessary to me
That is all very good
That is far from my thoughts
That is final and conclusive
That is the lesson of history
That is the question of questions
That you may conceive the force of
The answer is easy to find
The answer is ready
The belief is born of the wish
The broad principle which I would lay down
The circumstances under which we meet
The climax of my purpose in this address
The common consent of civilized mankind
The conclusion is irresistible
The confusing assertion is sometimes made
The day is at hand
The decided objection is raised
The doctrine I am combating
The doctrine is admirable
The effect too often is
The evolution of events has brought
The fact has made a deep impression on me
The fact has often been insisted
The fact to be particularly noted
The facts are clear and unequivocal
The facts may be strung together
The first business of every man
The first counsel I would offer
The first great fact to remember is
The first point to be ascertained
The first practical thought is
The first remarkable instance was
The first thing I wish to note
The first thing that we have to consider
The future historian will, no doubt
The generous feeling that has promoted you
The great mass of the people
The hour is at hand
The illustration is analogous
The important thing is
The instance I shall choose
The irresistible tendency of
The kindness with which I have been received
The last and distinguishing feature is
The latest inclination I have seen
The lesson which we should take most to heart
The main cause of all this
The more you examine this matter
The most concise tribute paid
The most reasonable anticipation
The most remarkable step forward
The most striking characteristic
The most sublime instance that I know
The next point is
The next question to be considered is
The next thing I consider indispensable
The occasion that calls us together
The one central difference between
The only course that remains open
The only plea to be offered
The other day I observed
The paramount consideration is
The perils that beset us here
The pleasing duty is assigned me
The point I have urged upon you is
The point I wish a little further to speak of
The point to which I shall call your attention
The popular notion is
The practical inference from all this
The presence of this brilliant assemblage
The pressing question is
The prevalent opinion, no doubt
The proof of this statement is to be found
The question is deeply involved
The question, then, recurs
The remedy I believe to be
The result of the whole
The result, I fancy, has been
The rule will always hold good
The sacred voice of inspiration
The same is true in respect of
The scene all comes back
The sentiment to which I am to respond
The sentiment which you have expressed
The simple rule and test
The simple truth is
The soundness of this doctrine depends
The strongest proof I have
The subject of the evening's address
The subject which has been assigned to me
The task has been placed in my hands
The testimony of history is
The theory seems at first sight
The thought with which I shall close
The time has manifestly now arrived
The time is not far distant
The time is now come for me
The times are full of signs and warnings
The toast I am about to propose to you
The vain wish has sometimes been indulged
The view I have been enforcing
The view is more misleading
The warmth and kindness of your reception
The welcome that has been extended to me
The whole story of civilization
Then again, in corroboration
Then again, when men say
Then take the other side of the argument
Then the question arises
Then there is another story
Then, too, it must be remembered
There are certain old truths
There are few spectacles
There are hopeful signs of
There are many educated and intelligent people
There are people in every community
There are several reasons why
There are some slight modifications
There are some who are fond of looking at
There are some who have an idea
There are those of us who can remember
There are those who wish
There are two conflicting theories
There are, I believe, many who think
There are, indeed, exceptions
There are, indeed, persons who profess
There can be but one answer
There can be no doubt
There has been a great deal of discussion lately
There has been no period of time
There have been differences of opinion
There is a characteristic saying
There is a class of person
There is a common saying
There is a conviction
There is a degree of evidence
There is a genuine grief
There is a great deal of rash talking
There is a growing disposition
There is a large class of thinkers
There is a lesson of profound interest
There is a more important question
There is a most serious lesson
There is a multitude of facts
There is a question of vital importance
There is a very common tendency
There is a vital difference of opinion
There is an analogy in this respect
There is an ancient story to the effect
There is an eternal controversy
There is another class of men
There is another factor
There is another object equally important
There is another point of view
There is another remarkable analogy
There is another sense in which
There is but one consideration
There is certainly no reason
There is hardly any limit
There is little truth in
There is no field of human activity
There is no good reason
There is no justification for
There is no mistaking the purpose
There is no more insidious peril
There is no more striking exemplification
There is no occasion to exaggerate
There is no page of history
There is no sense in saying
There is no worse perversion
There is not a shadow of evidence
There is nothing more repulsive
There is nothing overstated in this description
There is nothing to show
There is one story which it is said
There is only one sense in which
There is some difference of opinion
There is something strangely interesting
There is yet another distinction
There is yet one other remark
There is, at any rate, to be said
There is, however, another opinion
There is, however, one caution
There ought certainly to be
There was but one alternative
There was one remarkable incident
There will always be a number of men
There will be no difficulty
There yet remains
Therefore, there is no possibility of a doubt
Therein lies your responsibility
These alone would not be sufficient
These are enough to refute the opinion
These are general counsels
These are generalizations
These are my reasons for
These are points for consideration
These considerations have great weight with me
These exceptions do not hold in the case of
These ideas naturally present themselves
These instances are far from common
These instances are indications
These last words lead me to say
These objections only go to show
These questions I shall examine
These various partial views
They mistake the intelligence
They would persuade you to
Think for a moment
Think of the cool disregard
This absurdity arises
This appeal to the common sense
This argument is especially cogent 
This being the case
This being true
This being undeniable, it is plain
This being understood, I ask
This brings me to a single remark
This brings us to a subject
This episode goes to prove
This fact was soon made manifest
This from the nature of the case
This I conceive to be the business
This I consider to be my own case
This I have told you
This is a general statement
This is a very one-sided conception
This is a very serious situation
This is an astonishing announcement
This is conceded by
This is contrary to all argument
This is doubtless the truth
This is especially the case
This is essentially an age of
This is in the main just
This is like saying
This is not all
This is not the main point of objection
This is not the occasion or the place
This is obvious
This is on the whole reasonable
This is only another illustration of
This is owing in great measure to
This is precisely what we ought to do
This is said in no spirit of
This is suggested to us
This is the design and intention
This is the great fact
This is the main point on which the inquiry turns
This is the meaning of
This is the obvious answer
This is the point I want to impress upon you
This is the point of view
This is the position of our minds
This is the radical question
This is the sentiment of mankind
This is the starting-point
This is the sum
This is to be found in the fact
This is what I am led to say
This is what may be objected
This is why I take the liberty
This language is plain
This leads me to the question
This leads us to inquire
This may be said without prejudice
This might be illustrated at length
This much is certain
This sentiment was well-nigh universal
This will be evident at once
This you can not deny
This, at least, is sure
This, surely, is the conclusion
This, then, is the answer
This, then, is the drift of my illustration
This, then, is what I mean by saying
Those who have watched the tendencies
Thus a great deal may be done
Thus analogy suggests
Thus far, I willingly admit
Thus I am led on to another remark
Thus if you look into
Thus instances occur now and then
Thus it comes to pass
Thus much I may be allowed to say
Thus much may be sufficient to recall
Thus much, however, I may say
Thus my imagination tells me
Thus we see
Time would not permit me
To a man of the highest public spirit
To avoid all possibility of being misunderstood
To be more explicit
To be sure, we sometimes hear
To bring the matter nearer home
To convince them of this
To feel the true force of this argument
To illustrate
To make my story quite complete
To me, however, it would appear
To my way of conceiving such matters
To prevent misapprehension
To some it may sound like a paradox
To sum up all that has been said
To sum up in one word
To take a very different instance
To the conclusion thus drawn
To the enormous majority of persons
To these general considerations
To this I answer
To this it will be replied
To what other cause can you ascribe
To-day, as never before
Treading close upon the heels
Tried by this standard
True it is
True, there are difficulties
Truly it is a subject for astonishment
Two things are made very clear
Under all the circumstances
Under these favoring conditions
Under this head
Undoubtedly we may find
Unfortunately it is a truth
Unless I could be sure
Up to this moment I have stated
Very strange is this indeed
We all agree as to
We all feel the force of the maxim
We all in equal sincerity profess
We almost shudder when we see
We are accustomed to lay stress upon
We are all familiar with
We are approaching an era
We are apt to forget
We are assembled here to-day
We are beginning to realize
We are bound to give heed
We are constantly being told
We are fulfilling what I believe to be
We are in the habit of saying
We are met to-night
We are not able to prove
We are not disinterested
We are quite unable to speculate
We are told emphatically
We are tolerably certain
We believe with a sincere belief
We can but pause to contemplate
We can imagine the amazement of
We can not but be struck with
We can not escape the truth
We can not have this too deeply fixed
We can not too highly honor the temper of
We can not wonder
We can only applaud the sentiment
We can only bow with awe
We can presume
We can remember with pride
We can see to some extent
We continually hear nowadays
We deeply appreciate the circumstances of
We do not quarrel with those
We do not question the reality
We do well to recall
We easily persuade ourselves
We feel keenly about such things
We grope blindly along
We have a firm assurance
We have a right to claim
We have an overpowering sense
We have been accustomed to
We have been told by more than one
We have come together to-night
We have great reason to be thankful
We have heard lately
We have here plain proof
We have need to examine
We have no means of knowing
We have no other alternative
We have not yet solved the problem
We have sought on this occasion
We have the evidence of this
We have the good fortune to-night
We have to admit
We have witnessed on many occasions
We hear it is said sometimes
We hear no complaint
We heartily wish and mean
We hold fast to the principle
We laugh to scorn the idea
We may all of us agree
We may be permitted to remember
We may contemplate with satisfaction
We may have a deep consciousness
We may indeed consider
We may not know precisely how
We must also look
We must constantly direct our purpose
We must not be deceived
We must not mistake
We must realize conscientiously
We must remember
We need no proof to assure us
We need not look far for reasons
We need not trouble ourselves
We of this generation
We often hear persons say
We ought in strict propriety
We pride ourselves upon the fact
We rightly pay all honor
We see in a variety of ways
We shall all doubtless concede
We shall be blind not to perceive
We shall do well to remember
We shall have no difficulty in determining
We should be convinced
We should contemplate and compare
We should dread nothing so much
We should lend our influence
We should not question for a moment
We should not, therefore, question
We stand astonished at
We stumble and falter and fall
We take it for granted
We will not stop to inquire
Weighty as these conditions are
Well may we explain
Well, gentlemen, it must be confessed
Well, now, let us propose
Well, that being the case, I say
Were I to enter into a detailed description
Were I to speculate
What are the precise characteristics
What are we to think of
What are you going to do
What can avail
What can be more intelligible
What can be more monstrous than
What can I say better
What commonly happens is this
What could be more captivating
What could be more true
What do we gain by
What do we understand to have been
What I mean is this
What I now say is
What I object to is
What I propose to do is
What I shall actually attempt to show here
What I suggest is
What is more important
What is more remarkable
What is the pretext
What is this but to say
What more shall I say
What remains but to wish you
What strikes the mind so forcibly
What was the consequence of
What we are concerned to know is
What we have most to complain of
What would you say
What, then, are we to believe
What, then, can be the reason
What, then, I may be asked
What, then, is the use
What, then, was the nature of
Whatever a man thinks
Whatever difference of opinion may exist
Whatever opinion I may express
Whatever the truth may be
When I am told
When I hear it said
When I remember the history
When I review these circumstances
When I speak of this question
When I thus profess myself
When one remembers
When we consider the vastness
When we contemplate
When we get so far as this
When we look closely at
When will men understand
When you are assured
When you did me the honor to invite me
Whence it is, I say
Whence was the proof to come
While acknowledging the great value
While I feel most keenly the honor
While I have hinted to you
Whilst I am on this matter
Who can deny the effect
Who can say in a word
Who does not like to see
Who has not felt the contrast
Who that reads does not see
Who will accuse me
Why need you seek to disprove
Why, again, should I take notice
Will any gentleman say
Will anyone answer
Will it be whispered
Will it not be well for us
Will you allow me to present to you
Will you bear with me
Will you mistake this
Will you permit me to thank you
With all my heart I share
With possibly a single exception
With respect to what has been said
With this ideal clearly before us
With whatever opinions we come here
Without going into any details
Without my saying a word more
Yet I am convinced
Yet I am willing to admit
Yet I am willing to conclude
Yet I feel quite free to say
Yet I have never been thoroughly satisfied
Yet I suppose it is worth while
Yet I would have to think
Yet I, for one, do not hesitate to admit
Yet if you were to ask the question
Yet it is instructive and interesting
Yet it is no less true
Yet it is perfectly plain
Yet let me consider what consequences must
Yet may I not remind you
You all know the history of
You and I are always contrasting
You are at a parting of the ways
You are now invited to do honor
You can never forget
You can not assert
You do not need to be told
You have all read the story
You have been gracious enough to assign to me
You have been mindful
You have been pleased to confer upon me
You have but to observe
You have done me great honor
You have no right
You have not forgotten
You have often pondered over
You have sometimes been astonished
You know that it is impossible to
You know the legend which has grown up
You know very well
You may also be assured
You may be acquainted with
You may be sure
You may depend upon it
You may remember
You may well be proud
You may well study the example
You might apply to yourselves
You must not forget
You must understand I do not mean to claim
You ought not to disregard what I say
You remember how
You will allow me to say with becoming brevity
You will be pleased to hear
You will bear me out when I say
You will clearly understand
You will expect me to say something about
You will forgive me
You will join with me, I trust
You will observe
You will pardon me, I am sure
You will scarcely be surprised
You would never dream of urging
You yourselves are the evidence
Your friendly and generous words
Your good sense must tell you
Your presence seems to say
