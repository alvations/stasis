He dropped into an eloquent silence
He eludes analysis and baffles description
He glanced at her indulgently
He had the habit of self-engrossed silences
He harbored his misgivings in silence
He poured bitter and biting ridicule on his discomfited opponents
He spoke with sledgehammer directness
He suffers nothing to draw him aside
He took his courage in both hands
He turned on me a glance of stored intelligence
He was disheveled and untidy
He was inexhaustibly voluble
Heavily freighted with erudition 
Heights of serene contemplation
Her voice had a wooden resonance and a ghost of a lisp
Hidebound in official pedantry 
High and undiscouraged hope
High-handed indifference to all restraint
His chin had too vanishing an aspect
His first zeal was flagging
His general attitude suggested an idea that he had an oration for you
His gestures and his gait were untidy
His mood was one of pure exaltation
His plea was irresistible
His tone verged on the ironical
His work was ludicrously perfunctory
Hopelessly belated in its appearance
I adjured him 
I am not without a lurking suspicion
I bemoaned my unlucky fate
I could almost allege it as a supreme example
I have somewhat overshot the mark
I lost myself in a reverie of gratitude
I made bold to retort
I must hazard the story
I was extremely perplexed
I will permit myself the liberty of saying
I would fain believe

Oppressed by some vague dread
Organs of party rage and popular frenzy
Our opinions were diametrically opposed
Our vaunted civilization
Outward mark of obeisance and humiliation 
Overcome by an access of misery
Overshadowed by a fretful anxiety
Overwhelmed with reproach and popular indignation
Painful and lamentable indifference

Serve the innocent purposes of life
Set down with meticulous care
Shames us out of our nonsense
Sharp outbursts of hatred and bitterness
Sharp restrictions of duty and opportunity
Sharply and definitely conceived
She had lost her way in a labyrinth of conjecture
She took refuge in a passionate exaggeration of her own insufficiency
Sheer midsummer madness
Silly displays of cheap animosity
Simple and obvious to a plain understanding
Sinister and fatal augury 
Skulking beneath a high-sounding benevolence
Slack-minded skimming of newspapers
Slavish doctrines of sectarianism
Slow and resistless forces of conviction
Smug respectability and self-content
Snatch some advantage
Socialized and exacting studies
Some very undignified disclosures
Something essentially inexpressible
Something stifling and over-perfumed
Spinning a network of falsehoods
Spiritual and moral significance
Staring in helpless bewilderment
Stealthily escaping observation
Stern determination to inflict summary justice
Stigmatized as moral cowards
Stimulated to profitable industry
Stopped as if on the verge of profundities
Strange frankness of cynical brutality
Strange streak of melancholy
Strangled by a snare of words
Strenuous and conscientious endeavor
Stretched out in dreary monotony
Strict and unalloyed veracity
Struck incessantly and remorselessly
Stupendous and awe-inspiring spectacle
Subject to the vicissitudes of fortune 
Subjected to the grossest cruelties
Subordination to the common weal
Subservient to the ends of religion
Sudden and inexplicable changes of mood
Suddenly and imperatively summoned
Suddenly swelled to unprecedented magnitude
Sufficient to repel vulgar curiosity
Suggestive sagacity and penetration 
Suit the means to the end
Sullen and widespread discontent
Superior in strength and prowess
Supported by a splendid fearlessness
Supremely and undeniably great
Susceptible to every impulse and stimulus
Sustained dignity and mellifluous precision 
Swamping every aspiration and ambition
Swift and vehement outbursts of feeling
Take root in the heart
Take vengeance upon arrogant self-assertion
Taken in their totality
Tamed and wonted to a settled existence
Tempered by the emotional warmth of high moral ideals
That way madness lies
The abysmal depths of despair
The accumulated bitterness of failure
The agonies of conscious failure
The air was full of the cry and clamor
The animadversions of critics 
The applause was unbounded
The best proof of its timeliness and salutariness 
The bewildered and tumultuous world
The blackest abyss of despair
The blemishes of an extraordinary reputation
The bluntness of a provincial
The bogey of bad luck 
The bounding pulse of youth
The brunt of life
The capacity for refined pursuits
The charming omniscience of youth
The cloak of cowardice
The collective life of humanity
The combined dictates of reason and experience
The companion of a noble and elevated spirit
The complaining gate swung open
The complex phenomena of life
The consequence of an agitated mind
The consequence of ignorance and childish assumption
The constant pressure of anxieties
The creature and tool of a party
The critical eyes of posterity
The dead and dusty past
The delimitation is sufficiently definite
The dictates of plain reason
The disjointed babble of the chronicler
The dull derision of the world
The dullest and most vacant minds
The dumb forces of brute nature
The dupe of some imposture
The eager pretentiousness of youth
The ebb and flow of events
The everlasting deluge of books
The evil was irremediable
The exchange of harmless amenities
The exertion of an inherent power
The expression was keenly intellectual
The facile conjectures of ignorant onlookers
The facts took him by the throat
The fitful swerving of passion
The flabbiness of our culture
The flaccid moods of prose
The flame of discord raged with redoubled fury
The flattest and most obvious truisms
The flippant insolence of a decadent skepticism
