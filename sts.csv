STS2012-train	SMTeuroparl	3.750	The very worst situation is when the women concerned also come from distant countries, having taken the work on out of desperation because they have no other way of continuing to provide for themselves.

STS2015-gold	answers-forums	0.80	If you don't want to pay for Adobe Acrobat Pro, as @schultem mentions, LaTeX can do this with embedded hyperlinks.	If you don't mind hosting your files online, SlideShare is a good solution.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I think your method (thesis title in the education section) is the standard one.	Some people publish their theses as part of a monograph series.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I think it really depends on how long you plan to work without salary.	Why not just bring up the idea of staying in your current lab with your advisor?
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		My practice is to replace the initial preprint with the postprint as soon as it is accepted.	I believe you should never include "Submitted to Journal of Blah"; it conveys no information and it's tacky.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Doing outstanding research is what ultimately matters, not the rank of the university.	I don't entirely disagree with the two previous answers: taking the offer you have now may be a fine choice.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	2.40	I don't think there are likely to be any standards that address this issue specifically.	You're going to find answers all over the map for this one (i.e., there probably aren't "standards").
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Your question likely indicates that you need to work on your communication with your advisor.	My advice: don't read everything otherwise you will never finish!
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		If your paper are on arXiv you can use myarticles widget.	An even easier solution that doesn't require anything except the ability to upload a BibTeX file is Exhibit.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I know that TikZ was mentioned already, but I think it deserve its own answer.	Mathematica is actually good for making all sorts of graphics.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		plain text/markup language For mathematics, I think TeX/LaTeX is the way to go.	binary/plain text Other things to consider (for the future) is the movement towards standard meta-data items contained with the research articles (e.g.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I've seen three common ways of funding staff - undoubtedly there are more.	Funding for non-research positions comes from either direct or indirect sources.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	1.00	My answer would be depending on which GRE are you referring to?	The problem I see with the GREs is that the scoring range is highly compressed.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		A good starting point would be to talk to your research advisor about how to handle this, and follow his/her advice.	And, as a small point, if one's work is confidential for the reason that it is so extremely useful/important/wonderful (!?!
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		You could ask members of your doctoral committee to write you a letter of recommendation each.	You need to strategize with your advisor, or a trusted mentor, about this.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		You should do what makes you happy and you find interesting.	You can definitely apply in a different field than your undergraduate.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	0.20	If you have access to it, you can very easily do that with Thomson Reuters’ Web of Science portal.	You can have a look at the arXiv cultoromics website at http://arxiv.culturomics.org, which however searches in articles on the arXiv.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I did this in the earlier stages of my career, when every little bit of CV weight helped.	On the one hand, it shows that you are engaged in this necessary part of scientific research that is peer-review.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I can also add some other pointer I've come to learn over the years on what constitutes a good reviews.	There are certain things I look for when reviewing papers that are "show stoppers", i.e.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		A strong factor for most people will be the financial impact, i.e.	I applied to six graduate schools in my field, and was accepted at all of them.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I would allow rescheduling, but be sure to use a different exam.	In my school, redo exams have a maximum grade of the minimum grade to pass.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I have frequently had to micromanage my students' presentations and writeups.	The first thing I would do is improve/repair your personal relationship with your adviser.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I'm going to answer this question based on my understanding of copyright law in the United Kingdom.	German copyright is very different from UK or US copyright.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	0.60	In general there are a number of different distinct workflows that lead to a poster.	For completeness, Apple's Pages has quite a few nice poster layouts.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		In my field a peer reviewed article counts for a lot more than a chapter in an edited book.	Like a lot of things in academia, I think this will heavily depend on what discipline you're in.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		For everything that have been reviewed AND permanently archived then the bibliography is fine.	The best practice is to include standard bibliographic information, a relatively stable hypertext link for current readers (e.g.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Many universities have a unit devoted to providing support with grant applications.	If you are writing proposals for NSF consider volunteering as a reviewer in your discipline.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I agree with the other answer that this is a normal occurrence.	Depending on which country you are talking about, there may be league tables for the universities in that country.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	3.60	It is perfectly okay to ask for the figure knowing well that the other person may not give.	You can always ask, then it is the choice of the author to accept or not.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		There are no services to help you get that coursework accredited.	Most of the courses that I've seen explicitly state that you obtain no credit for doing the course.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		In my very personal opinion MDPI is an reputable publisher, but their journals are not first-class.	The peer review process generally differs between predatory and non predatory journals.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I think what you are asking can be carried out using Web of Science.	Adding to Gopi's comment, here's a snapshot of Academic map at work.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		aeismail's answer points out two very important points: the deal-breakers and the PD purgatory.	Actually, I think the frame of this question isn't quite right.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		The biggest problem with such repositories is that someone has to maintain them.	If you have access to it, you can very easily do that with Thomson Reuters’ Web of Science portal.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		In general, I believe, that graduate science education is not a good choice from a purely financial standpoint.	You didn't mention if you want to do an MS in the UK or the US.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		As you do more things, you can become more selective with what you list.	First of all: note that there is a difference between an academic CV and a resume.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I have one addendum to the great answers by F'x Pedro, and Henry.	From your description, it sounds like the problem is more likely to have been the MSc supervior than the student.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		One thing that I haven't seen mentioned yet is intellectual property rights.	Whatever you are going to do after PhD is your business.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	0.20	The academic year does start around September in the USA and I think most European countries.	I would not accelerate things, to avoid getting worse grades that you want.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		A book I would recommend is Kosslyn's Graph Design for the Eye and Mind.	The preeminent author on this topic is Edward Tufte, who wrote "The Visual Display of Quantitative Information".
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		If you can re-take the GREs without undue burden -- yes, re-take them.	Many PhD programs in computer science (like my own) don't require GREs; read the application instructions carefully.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	0.20	I will advise exactly the contrary of what bravo just said in another answer : go for A !	You could defer admission, but it's a little unusual to defer for a year.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		http://www.glassdoor.com/ works by getting anonymous information from users and sharing it.	I think this page has what you are looking for.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		"All of the above"... but maybe not wanting a book that started from a primer on Linear Algebra.	The answer can best be understood in terms of the intended goal of the researcher making the switch.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		This is such a loaded question I'm hesitant to answer.	Like @Suresh says, in the US, I would expect that the advisor-advisee relationship would be separate from enrollment in the department.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		At some universities, a Post-Doctoral Fellow is a different title than a Post-Doctoral Researcher due to federal regulations in the USA.	In addition to Suresh's answer, I'd say that a postdoc is no longer a student.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		For presentations, when you are using graphics from other papers, you refer to the paper.	There are two parts to this question: citation and copyright issues.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Remember that Europe is a big place, comprised of lots of different countries.	There are tough (read respectable) and relatively easy (read weaker) schools and PhD programs in both sides.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Here's an answer based on my experience in the United States.	Everywhere I've attended and worked in Britain, I've called teachers by their first name and been called my first name.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		A link to a profile page that makes it clear you're a grad student should be enough.	Personally I hate signatures, I see it as trying to make a superficial impression based on a title.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		is there a way to measure my own reviewing bias?	There aren’t many ways for your to evaluate how your reviews stand against others, but there is at least one.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I'll tackle the easiest side of the question first: bringing nothing should not create trouble.	A gift to show your gratitude will always be appreciated.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Applying to Masters Program does not really depend on one single factor but a variety of factors.	Yes, the acknowledgements section of your paper is an appropriate place to thank anyone who provided valuable assistance.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I feel like pointing out that the very use of the word 'productivity' reflects a certain kind of bias towards "quantity".	There is no accepted numerical measure for an individual's academic productivity.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		PubMedCentral gives you full text and their API may be able to do it.	There seems to be no service or tool that let's you download articles in bulk.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		This recent Nature news item would seem to suggest rather strongly that SCIRP is not a serious outfit.	Yes, I do indeed have some direct experience with them.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I checked the peer review policy of Nature and Science, I guess that should is the best we can get.	Well, as you said, there is no rule that explicitly says that the information mentioned in a “invitation to review” is confidential.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I don't know how common it is, but certainly some institutions allow student papers.	Have you tried asking your supervisor to deposit the papers?
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	0.00	Edit, again: The question seems to have changed, yet again.	I can think of three reasons why a faculty member might reveal how a student performed on a qualifying examination.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		True story: a bottle of wine (well, maybe just half a bottle).	Second, I try to process 10 or so exams before actually marking any of them.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Script only the introduction I can only echo what Artem said about the disadvantages of a script.	I think a script is actually more harmful than good.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	0.00	I agree with Seteropere completely, "Network Science" is a very broad subject.	I would say you are approaching it in the wrong way.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I prefer to group definitions of notation and symbols with the typical "List of ..." elements.	Email the work to someone (or yourself) well before you hand it over.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		If you use bibtex, then you can batch edit with things like sed, awk, or simple find/replace in any text editor.	In my experience, the author syntax changes if you're using DOI or PMID.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I think the answer to your question is very dependent on your subject and the culture of that research area.	I agree that reference formatting for a thesis tends to follow university and discipline specific guidelines.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		The first rule, as usual, is: what is expected of you?	I always view "we" as "you and the reader" and you and your reader journey through the subject together.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I would say that it depends on the complexity you get out of it.	You should definitely consider publishing the algorithm, but not before you could say something more than merely a pseudocode.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		How many publications or conference papers would you get out of this work?	I've known of a few cases of people prolonging their Ph.Ds to improve their CVs.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	1.20	Supporting an ideology in an ostentatious manner (rather than privately or discreetly) is a personality problem.	I think for an appropriate answer I'd need to know exactly what the 'bad' ideology is.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		When asking a question, it is desirable to explicitly establish a non-confrontational tone.	My personal preference is not to offer a compliment in this setting.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I will advise exactly the contrary of what bravo just said in another answer : go for A !	For questions 1 and 2: it depends: you have to find out from your individual advisor/department/university.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		If there's a medical reason for it and the student can produce an appropriate doctor's certificate or what not.	You will definitely need to check regulations regarding the wearing of costumes that conceal one's appearance.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	0.00	This does not fully answer your question, but it is certainly one consideration.	I am a PhD student in Computational Science, which is an interdisciplinary major spanning mathematics, computer science, and engineerning.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		TV-L is the German public servant remuneration grade table (Tarifvertrag für den Öffentlichen Dienst der Länder (TV-L)).	I am sure a psychologist could provide an indepth analysis to a large part of this question.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		nobody cares about your university, the only important thing at least in Europe is your CV.	Does doing a postdoc mean a commitment to an academic career?
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		The biggest obstacle is that you haven't been through a Ph.D. program.	It can be very difficult to get government financing depending on where you reside.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	0.40	A few possible problems: 1) Such an ID system seems a little intrusive.	In mathematics, we already have a database of this sort - two them, in fact, with in MathSciNet and Zentralblatt MATH.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Short answer: The full name is Izvestiya Akademii Nauk SSSR, Tekhnicheskaya Kibernetika.	As others have said, not every (old) article has a DOI or a URL.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		In your case, how do you find 14 good leaders from 70 students?	My armchair researching dug up a lot of articles about this.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		It depends on whether the black hole is rotating or not.	It's complicated, and it depends on what you mean by "black hole".
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	0.40	As an complement to the other answers, let me address the question of why planets tend towards tidal locking.	The other answers here are fantastic at explaining in a technical sense.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	3.00	Stars are rotating, but that's not the cause for their stability.	Stars rotate due to the angular momentum of the gas they formed from.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Of course the apparent relative sizes of the sun and moon are coincidental.	As a matter of fact, yes, it is only a coincidence.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	4.40	It indeed appears the Andromeda galaxy (M31) and The Milky Way (MW) are en route to a collision.	In a few billion years, the Milky Way and Andromeda will collide.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Stellar mass black holes form from the collapse of massive stars at the end of their lives.	Stellar mass black holes and supermassive black holes likely form from very different mechanisms.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		The metal content of the Solar system is completely dominated by the Sun.	The metals that are forming in the sun come from nuclear fusion.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	3.20	The short answer is: we are made from the "stuff" contributed by many stars.	It is highly unlikely that we're made out of stuff from only one star.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	3.40	All we know is this : Distant objects are receding from us at a rate proportional to their distance from us.	The expansion of space means that objects in cosmological distances are receding away from each other.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		When you sit in a car, and you suddenly brake, you feel the change in velocity.	If you're big enough and fluid enough, like an atmosphere, you would feel acceleration do to the Earth's motion.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		There is no 'still' that is not relative to some other object.	The so called expansion of the universe is not as trivial as most people think.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	3.40	Like Chris said above, stars rotate to conserve their angular momentum.	Stars are rotating, but that's not the cause for their stability.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		The light will eventually reach galaxy B even though the space between them is expanding.	To answer your question: The speed of light is relative to the metric of the space itself.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	3.60	According to this website the peak visible magnitude will be about 10.5 around February 2nd.	The AAVSO data seems to indicate that it might have already peaked, at around 10.5 (visual).
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	0.80	All of these effects are related to the 11 year solar cycle.	I will be specific to answering the part regarding the prediction of solar flares.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Dark matter, is just a name for something we know nothing of.	Light may account for a small portion of dark matter, but it is unlikely to account for most/all of it.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Compared to the planets the moon changes it's rise and set times very quickly.	The moon didn't abruptly change position, it is gradually and continually changing position.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	0.80	We are moving "... relative to the comoving cosmic rest frame ... at some 371 km/s towards the constellation Leo".	There is no 'still' that is not relative to some other object.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	1.00	Yes, it's true that the apparent size of the Moon is 30 arcmin.	When you gaze at the moon "live", you are not seeing a still image.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	1.60	Let us assume the data for a globular cluster to be equivalent to that of M13.	Globular clusters occupy an interesting place in the spectrum of composite stellar systems.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		You'll probably need spectrometer data to distinguish and identify spectral lines.	No, amateur astronomy equipment is not capable of doing such an analysis.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		To complete Envite's answer, I would point that you can easily experience that irregularity yourself.	Any body with an irregular mass distribution will experience those wobblings.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		4 billion years is the same timeframe of the life remaining to our Sun.	Normally when two galaxies collide, it is the gas that interacts with each other.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		The outer shell of the star contains still a lot of hydrogen, after running out of fuel.	If something crashed into it rearranging its content a bit, could its life be extended?
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	1.00	Why is the speed of light 299,792,458 m/s, and not (for instance) 3,1 or 4,3 x 10^44 m/s?	Speed of light being finite is one of the fundamentals of our Universe.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Molten Iron and hot sand - it's not easy to think of something more extreme than this.	So far, we don't have anywhere near enough detail to identify weather on planets in other star systems.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		What you're asking, basically, is whether there are any proofs for the heliocentric model of the Solar System.	According to Newton, any binary system revolves around the center of mass.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		It very much depends on where on the globe you are in terms of your latitude.	To add to TidalWave's answer, here's another way to think about it.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Only a very small fraction of the elements in the core the supernova get converted into heavier elements.	For a star to become a nova, it needs to have a mass at least 8 times greater than our sun.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	3.20	As per your definition, a star formed in a binary system (hence near some gravitating body) is a generalised planet.	The main flaw with your definition of a "generalised planet" would be the boundary between stars and planets.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		One additional source of evidence comes from other spiral galaxies.	In addition to @MBR's answer; there are other (less confusing) ways to represent the data.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		What you're asking, basically, is whether there are any proofs for the heliocentric model of the Solar System.	A black hole has an event horizon which 'marks the point of no return'.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Naively, I would say that you're looking for a periodicity in the luminosity.	Any body with an irregular mass distribution will experience those wobblings.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		The energy density of the universe is quite well known.	No energy is in transit as GRBs, just like Gamma rays that started in a GRB.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Even though I'm a professional astronomer (but not an expert on this field), I don't have a good answer.	I can't give you an explicit ant mathematical explanation but maybe this simulations give you a hint.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Light may account for a small portion of dark matter, but it is unlikely to account for most/all of it.	In addition to @MBR's answer; there are other (less confusing) ways to represent the data.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		The mass luminosity relation is non-linear (L = M^3.5 for the main sequence) so more massive stars burn at a much faster rate.	The easiest way to think of it is terms of the cube square law coming into play.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Well, when two black holes collide a new black hole is created.	There are currently three classifications of black hole and these are stellar, super massive and miniature.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		There is a prior answer here claiming that "a moon with a moon would be an unstable system".	I don't think there are any in the Solar system.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		As far as I know all accretion disks are prograde.	Consider a binary system with a neutron star and a companion star.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		From 1979 to 1999, Pluto was the eighth planet from the sun.	No, Pluto is a so called resonant trans-neptunian object; the orbital period of Pluto is almost exactly 3:2 (1.5) times that of Neptune.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	2.00	A method used to calculate the distance between stars is 3 Dimensional trigonometry.	You only need two-dimensional trigonometry if you know the distances to the two stars and their angular separation.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		The light will eventually reach galaxy B even though the space between them is expanding.	To any observer between 'A' and 'B' where the light wave passes, it passes with the speed of light.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Like Afzaal Ahmad said black holes evaporate through Hawking radiation, proposed by Stephen Hawking in 1974.	Yes, everything that is in this universe has to say Good bye to its existence.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		You're experiencing a few issues all of which have one solution.	Regarding the fact of using the scope indoors: it's understandable, but silly.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Space, as we experience it, is simply three-dimensional Euklidean (flat) space.	Particle like, molecule or atoms or any smallest particle behaves differently in different environment.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Stars can form in circumstellar disks, that are, in general, disks surrounding forming stars, but not in protoplanetary disks.	Yes, unless you want to get really particular with the "protoplanetary" part.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	0.00	The farther away, the faster the galaxies move away from us.	Here is my answer to a similar question posted on the physics stack exchange website.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		The programs I am aware of that you could use do require some programming expertise to operate.	Yes, there is are two python modules called astropy, and astropysics that both claim to have spectral analysis tools.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Main difference (beyond mass, which we can extrapolate to make giant clusters and small galaxies touch) is star age.	There are a couple of important distinctions between the two types of objects.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		No, the orbiting rocket was not visible to the naked eye.	In the protostar stage of the Sun, it was surrounded by a (spinning) gas cloud.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		From a (more) physics standpoint our acceleration on earth is basically zero from what we can feel.	When you sit in a car, and you suddenly brake, you feel the change in velocity.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		After all these astronomic answers, I will add a computer one.	Yes, it's true that the apparent size of the Moon is 30 arcmin.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I think you mean to ask, "What is the local sidereal time of Greenwhich?".	Right Ascension is a celestial coordinate, not a terrestrial one.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I believe your confusion is from combining two popular simplifications of our Universe.	The surface of the 4-dimensional ball (called 3-sphere) is a slice through the universe as a whole for a fixed cosmic time.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Yes, we always look into the past, when looking somewhere.	I think the question is referring to situating a very large mirror in space facing earth.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		This is one of the great remaining mysteries of the universe.	In these quantum theories, forces are mediated by particles called gauge bosons.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Yes, binary comets do exist; 8P/Tuttle is an example of one.	If the closing velocity is very low, the energy can be dissipated by the comets squishing.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		No - Distances between objects get larger, but galaxies and clusters are dominated locally by gravity.	Ummm this question made me think about a lecture from my teacher.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Nickel plating can improve the surface, but it's not easy in detail: paper on nickel plating.	The aluminum oxide layer forms as soon as oxygen comes in contact with the mirror surface.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		The colorful patterns of gas are caused by excitation of gas atoms, e.g.	You might be interested in these two answers: How dense are nebulae?
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		This has not been answered yet for sure I guess.	You are making the mistake of thinking that there was a single spot in space that everything expanded from.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		There are a few more elements which you might consider.	The tail particles from a comet are ejected, so they have a distinct velocity than that of the comet.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Gravitational lensing is the effect that large amounts of gravity have on the path of light.	One star passes in front of another from our perspective.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Pluto: It was disqualified as a planet because orbital dominance was not achieved in the case of Pluto.	Disclaimer: Most of what is written here is based highly on theory and speculation.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		No, not all total lunar eclipses will turn the Moon deep red.	The redness of the moon is due to Earth's atmosphere refraction of Sun rays and pollution - dust particles etc.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		What I mean to say is, how are the characteristics of event horizon related to Space-Time?	Depends on how the angular momentum (that manifests itself as Earth's rotation) would be absorbed.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		In addition to Undo's fine answer, I would like to explain a bit about the motivation behind the definition.	The correct answer is 8 (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune).
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		charon and pluto are tidally locked, as is the moon to the earth.	It would require a very precise trajectory for an asteroid to end up in geostationary orbit.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	0.60	Stars form in star-formation regions, which itself develop from molecular clouds.	It may be possible for a solar system like ours to exist outside of a galaxy.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		If so by how much does it "spoil" the view of stars and galaxies etc.	It does not act as a solid lens, because it does not have a limit surface.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Well, Kepler has explained that 2 randomly moving objects, attracted towards each other, will always form elliptical orbits.	When an object is in orbit, there are two factors at play, not just one.

STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Astronomers use this system simply because it is (was) convenient.	In order to know when a star will be above horizon, you'll need an equation with times, not "celestial latitudes".
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		In the upper photosphere, the electrons join with the ions to neutralize the atom.	Emission and Absorption lines are due to Kirchhoff's Laws that explain what happens when light passes through a gas.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Over the past 150 years, telescope technology has improved immensely, so we can now see much further than in the past.	There are a couple of different horizons you should care about.

STS2015-gold	answers-forums		In this particular case the correct word to use is 'less', since 'people' is a mass/collective noun.	I would say "fewer people"; and it is indeed linked to count vs uncount nouns.

STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I'd leave it singular unless talking about a range such as "0.25 - 2 miles".	It's really not complicated or confusing if you think of it in terms of being a fraction.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		The subject of the sentence were the payments, and not the total number of payments, therefore were is correct.	Since "payment" is countable, I would go with "were" to reinforce the notion that there was more than one payment.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		"Religious practice" is far more common than "religious praxis" (500 000 vs. 15 000 results in Google).	The word praxis is definitely an extremely formal academic word.

STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Germany, was, without doubt, defeated, even though the siutation of the Armistice allowed the impression to develop that it wasn't.	I don't think it is possible to idenitify a single point in history as beginning the "slope toward the end".
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		The USA had won the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq in any military sense.	It's still possible for an invaded people to lose if the odds are TOO overwhelming.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		From a military perspective, an "all out war" deep into enemy territory without any logistics is a rare occasion.	Sherman's "March to the Sea" hurt the CSA's economy and helped to end the war.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		At the moment of his election (1641), it seems that Mazarin was in minor orders - so called "lay cardinal".	According to Cardinal Richelieu's Wikipedia page he was a cardinal priest until December 4, 1642, the day of his death.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		There was actually a trade route through Ukraine - "из варяг в греки" - that is "From Varangians to the Greeks".	In those days, most of the people of the "Ukraine" lived in the western part of the province (around Kiev).
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		This is a very simplified example but hopefully it will help: Assume that there are 10 nobles and 100 workers.	Just to expand on the disease angle, at its height, Zambia's population was 3% European.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Languages are not static things; they evolve with the times and the needs of the users.	The question makes no sense so I voted to close it.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	1.20	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Delhi#Early_history shows that the city was called Delhi (or Dilli) at least since the 12/13th century.	I am not exactly sure but I remember the media (in India) addressing Delhi as "HASTHINA".
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Let's do the math: 100,000 mounted archers * 4 horses each * 10 kg/day * 250 days/campaign = 1,000,000,000 kg of forage required each campaign.	This is not really an answer to your question, but the following numbers look much more realistic.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Actually most of the defence force was successfully evacuated, not surrendered.	If the Commonwealth "surrendered prematurely at Crete," it was in the fighting around the Maleme airfield.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I think this question presumes far to much determinism on the part of the "Great Purge" process.	Apart from advocating scientific management, Gastev was a proletariat smithy(kuznitsa) poet.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		You can get a breakdown of the major causes of death here.	Bruce Catton's history and Shelby Foote's history should have the details.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		For Mongols specifically, it was in part their unparallelled-till-20th-century tactical flexibility.	You might also ask why these people from the steppes also created so much havoc in CHINA.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Encouraged by the kind words about my comment, I have turned it into an answer with more details and sources.	The truth is that Germany ways de-facto the leader in the majority of sciences from the end of XIX century.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Here are some rough specs for common planes (as I said in the comment, the endurance depends on various factors).	All depends on the aircraft, development went very quickly during WW1.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Yes, SU did its best to make sure that its satellites were controlled as tightly as possible.	This is unfortunately the only source I could find which describes COMECON's imperialist tendencies in great detail.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	2.20	Dominus, plural Domini, in ancient Rome, “master,” or “owner,” particularly of slaves.	A greek-speaking slave (δούλος, doulos) I think would call his master κύριος (translit: kurios; lord, master, sir; vocative form: κύριε).
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Every 1000 years or so you can expect a large "1000-year-flood" near large rivers.	I think the question totally glosses over the fact that "East Pakistan" was created out of the partition of Bengal.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Germany was fortunate to have a large batch of officers born in the 1890s.	To my impression this reflects systematic bias of the sources you use, possibly, sources circulating in your country and/or language.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	0.60	The bulk of India then was not controlled by Porus, but by the Nanda dynasty, centered at Pataliputra.	I believe Alexander lost heart after his horse, Bucephelus, died from a wound received in the battle against Porus.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I agree with the New World statement, classes are something inherited from kingships, Like the nobility is the highest class.	Even if somebody can rise to height, does not make a society classless.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Song of Solomon (as you mentioned in your comments) does have some erotic contents.	Romance is hardly a western construct; it's universal among all humans.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		The Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan in the late 20th century has its roots in the "Great Game" of the 19th century.	I think everyone who has posted here (@ihtkwot, @mgb, @Russell) have all brought up important points.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		There is evidence of English longbows shooting farther than 250 yards, particularly at Crecy, where the longer bowshots were around 300 yards.	Too many factors at work to really say 'a bow has a range of X'.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		It did exist but no one is sure what it was.	It was pitch/tar and oil that was ignited and sprayed if my memory serves me correctly.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	2.60	Yes, this is true and yes, in most cases indefinite articles indeed developed from numerals, as @MGN already said.	Indefinite articles developed from numerals, and the definite articles developed from demonstratives.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		The Hawaiian language has seen a big revival in the past 20-30 years.	Sanskrit has been a subject of revival efforts since the 1908s in various villages in India.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I'll also throw in that some languages also have grammatical gender in their verbs.	Romance languages have (generally speaking) three classes of verbs, inherited from Latin.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	3.00	Preserving grammaticality and preserving meaning of the sentence are two different things.	In fact, you can remove pretty much and preserve grammaticality if you don't care about preserving meaning.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Let's say that a future participle is a non-finite form of a verb which is marked for future tense.	Latin forms the future participle of most verbs (futurus, moriturus), Russian only form the verb to be (будущий).
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	2.20	In some nowadays Indo-European languages you can still see rests of base-20 numeral systems.	Modern Englishes, and many other well-known languages, use base 10 (ie decimal) systems of numerals.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Just to add this: what is usually called Hebrew script was in fact borrowed from Aramaic.	The source for this is in a book called The Coming Revolution by Zamir Cohen.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I'm going to answer about just the words for "pineapple".	@Joe has covered words for "pineapple", so here's some info on words for "banana".
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Only to the degree that all Slavic languages are somewhat mutually intelligible.	Bluntly, Slovak and Slovenian have nothing in common other than being both Slavic languages.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Language can "improve" over time as well as "just changing".	"Are modern languages in any non-arbitrary way superior to ancient languages, e.g.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Well there aren't phonemes in signed languages because phonemes are specifically sounds.	Historically, signed phonemes were considered to fall into 4 (or 5 depending on who you ask) categories that are sometimes called parameters.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		The classical, pure versions of Mesoamerican languages used for the most part a base-20 system.	Modern Englishes, and many other well-known languages, use base 10 (ie decimal) systems of numerals.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		No, this is not the only example of a language that was developed de novo.	There is also the Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language, which developed under similar circumstances (isolated deaf community) in the south of Israel.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Partially, it depends on how you think of what the goal of Linguistics is.	Broadly speaking, there is a linguistic continuum across Northern India.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I disagree partly with this answer claiming that 'aa' and 'ağ' are identical.	I am a native turkish speaker living in İstanbul, 30 years old.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I have not heard of a language that lacks numbers entirely, and doubt one exists (happy to see proof though).	Would you count a language that has lost most of its (original) number system?
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		As many pointed out, 'free word order' is a complete misnomer.	Thank you all for giving examples of word order in your mother language.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	1.80	The difficulty arises not from the various linguistic properties of the language pair as many here suggest.	It depends on generally syntactic structure of two languages and -yes- some pragmatic issues.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		The question can be explored in terms of N-ellipsis (noun ellipsis, also known as NP-ellipsis).	I agree with Thomas that the situation in English and in German is not the same.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Regarding Romanian's history: it's a member of the Eastern Romance (sensu strictu) subfamily or the "Vlach" languages.	One possibility is because of its relative isolation from the other Latin-based languages.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Matt Davis provides a useful summary related to this meme.	I couldn't read the first and not the second much either.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		To begin with, the Chinese phoneme is not exactly sh but it sounds more like k in Swedish käften.	This word can well be connected with its Chinese counterpart.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		That's actually a diagnostic test for what is a "Proper Noun" in English-- it resists taking an article.	I'm not an expert, but in my experience this is common in Galician and Spanish.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		The picture of the synthesis degree is not very clear in many languages.	For those unsure of terminology, "analytic" refers to how many morphemes group together to make a word.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I say option D. When in doubt, you can try what Web browsers do.	TL;DR: Option D is the answer, and Option E may be an answer with minor corrections.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		There are curious adjunct uses of "of-phrases" as in "a man of honor", which correspond to the Latin genitive of description.	Here are some cases where an adjunct (always locative) comes before the "of" complement.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		What the hearer perceives must clearly be called a phoneme.	I am not sure if there is a word for no.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Is your question about an analysis or about automated parsing?	As Ivan writes, the example in the question is indeed an example of so-called right node raising (RNR).
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Remember that the intersection of the outputs of two context-free languages is not necessarily context free.	weak context-freeness: can the language be analyzed by a CF grammar at all?
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	0.60	In English, certainly the most common use of do is Do-Support.	In traditional grammar, the word doing is a participle in all your examples.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	0.00	A caveat: I'm experiencing the tail end of a three day migraine.	I agree with the commentators that your question is a little confusing.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		A long time ago, LanguageTool used to be usable with just OpenOffice.	You may want to have a look at OpenNLP http://opennlp.apache.org/.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		This issue is discussed in some detail in this paper by the late, great linguist Larry Trask.	Although it is a strong tendency it is still only a tendency.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	1.60	The reason for this is that Russian is a much more tonal language than English.	Although I am quite fluent in Russian, I wouldn't say English sound particularly 'cold' to me.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	0.80	Palatalisation of /k/ before front vowels happens all over the place: Russian, Greek, Turkish, Persian etc.	Sinhala, one of the languages spoken in Sri Lanka has a four way deixis system.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	0.20	All the same methods of analysis that are used with spoken languages apply successfully to signed languages.	One idea that's been going around at least since the 80s is that you can distinguish between Holds and Moves.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	1.00	Newspeak, a "deliberately impoverished" language designed to prevent people from communicating and thinking about subversive ideas.	Every language is permeated by the cultural values in which it is immersed.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		The dirty little secret of English is that syllable boundaries mostly do not matter (unlike other languages).	Unfortunately, there is no straightforward syllabification method that is accepted by a majority of linguists.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Well since your question contains nothing to compare to and is therefore ambiguous, the answer could only be yes.	The more languages you know, the easier it generally is to learn new ones.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Contrary to some of the other answerers, I do think "intuition blurring" is a real thing.	Languages can often be distinguished based on prosodic information alone.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Perhaps you could start by studying how you pronounce English /w/, which consists of simultaneous labial and velar approximation.	Try looking in a mirror into your mouth while producing some words like "fill feel hello ladle larry bottle etc".
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	2.80	In Russian, for example, animacy is not clear-cut in the distinction animate/inanimate.	As in Russian, Polish marks animate masculine nouns by having a genitive-accusative vs. the nominative-accusative of inanimate masculines.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	0.60	As you can see from this map on the Wals.info site, there are many.	This is an example I always find is helpful for first year.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		One interesting source of information comes from what old prescriptive grammarians found to gripe about.	No, It doesn't make sense for exactly the reasons you posited.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		If you want a very quick and simple program to slow down a sound file of speech, use VLC Player.	Free software, 'Audacity', can apply and preserve, as well as infinitely undo, many useful transformations in any selections of the audio.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		There's a lot of types of signed languages (some more like sign vocabularies), so not all have the same properties.	The biggest problem with signing is that you can't talk to a person without first getting their attention.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Sounds like you have a great idea for developing linguistics software!	To some extent, there are rules you can apply to pronounce, say, teaching based on the known pronunciation of teach.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		With some help from Rocío, I have found a fairly useful resource (in the bibliography of Greenberg).	When writing my dissertation about Language and Identity I found these two references: Bugarski, R. (1997).
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		It sounds like what you are really looking for is linguistic evidence of a Semitic substrate in Old English.	The Balkan sprachbund is a group of languages which have interspersed grammatical features among each other.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Another example of the same combination of gnarly syllable structure and tone is Tlingit, where words like [tʃχánkʼ] ‘grandkid’ and [ɬʔùɬ.tʃí.nì] ‘vest’ occur.	I think that the basic observation about agglutinative languages generally not having complex tonal systems is pretty well upheld.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		It actually has nothing to do with a phonological rule, per se.	I doubt the explanations given elsewhere in this thread very much.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		English spelling did deteriorate, due to almost abruptive historical changes.	Language can "improve" over time as well as "just changing".
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		It is, however, main-stream Indo-Europeanist theory that the suffix * -es marks both the genitive singular and the nominative plural m/f in proto-Indo-European.	There is a paper by Pavel Caha on Lingbuzz that addresses this exact question.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	2.80	Zipf’s law, as I understand it, is not really about languages, but about statistics and probability.	As with all natural laws, Zipf's law is an approximation.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Palatalisation of /k/ before front vowels happens all over the place: Russian, Greek, Turkish, Persian etc.	The same goes for [g] : [ǵ] and [l] : [ĺ], and no other consonant.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I may be missing something but isn't this more a question of negation scope.	I do not know that I have a proper answer, but I would like to summarize my findings.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I think there is a need for a comprehensive review of the origins of the features of Indian Linguistic Area.	I wouldn't hundred percent subscribe to Tamil (refering here to classical Tamil Sangam poetry) being mora-timed.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		In speech, of course, rhythm and intonation would probably make it clear what the speaker meant.	I have probably turned myself into a machine, but the sentences I was driving against the traffic towards London.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		If you want to go in depth, check the links.	There are formalized dependency-based grammars, such as Meaning-Text Theory or Functional Generative Description.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		The modern Moscow school asserts that PIE was predated by Proto-Eurasiatic.	The answer is that we do not know (and possibly never will).
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I agree completely with the comment by @Alenanno, Jun 29 at 15:07.	Although I am quite fluent in Russian, I wouldn't say English sound particularly 'cold' to me.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		The example of Piraha shows that Chomsky's basic claim about language is incorrect, and that's it.	A sort of squabble played out a few years ago on the pages of Language.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		There is at least one case I can think of in English similar to this.	Latin has a pretty large class of nouns like these, which are actually called abundantia in the grammatical tradition.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		One powerful husband and wife couple had created an organization before Interlingua was formalized.	First of all, this goal is seen as somewhat utopic today.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		The Japanese case marker =ga (a post-clitic), was not originally a subject marker.	First, I am going to address Tangurena's answer (I don't have enough reputation to add a comment).
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Wikipedia's page on lenition seems to suggest that a /t/ -> /θ/ change can actually come from a /t/ -> /tθ/ (affrication) -> /θ/ (spiratization) change.	I would really give not an answer but somewhat refusal for the question (despite the question is really good).
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Most English words have roots in Indo-European, either through original Germanic or through borrowed Latin, French, or Greek words.	As you can probably guess, there are several ways to determine the etymology of words.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I'm afraid this is wishful thinking on the part of some instructor.	As others have pointed out, it seems that you probably meant to discuss homo*phones*, and I'll proceed on that assumption.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		In Witness for the Defense, Elizabeth Loftus describes how police questioning can influence witnesses into recalling events that never happened.	The most interesting research is experimental work on grammatical gender and functional words (like prepositions).
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		What those "childish errors" really show are that children are generating language, not just repeating it.	With due regard to @mollyocr's answer, I shall answer my own question.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	1.60	A part of the question thusfar unattended is whether the concept of phoneme has always been contentious.	"Phoneme" is a theoretical construct which probably can't go away.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		You should clarify the question a bit to make sure you mean 'writing systems', not languages.	In the Old Ethiopic language Ge'ez a double dot (:) was used to separate words.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	1.40	If you arecomming from the non-linguistics environment, the best book is to start with Is Fromkin, Introduction to language.	This is what they recommend at Oxford as introductory textbooks to students starting a Masters' in Linguistics.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		My estimation would be between 1000 and 500 years ago, after population drifts but before the European conquest.	One problem is, as you've identified, how to define "language".
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	1.40	From what I'm seeing it's generally accepted that most English speakers have a vocabulary size of 15000 to 20000 words.	According to a statistical estimation I know roughly 7000 words in English.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		"Not fast" is in Arabic ليست سريعة (pronounced something like "lessat sahirah").	In fact, it seems to be the case that you do get /r/ in those contexts and specific words (also, 'squash', etc.).

STS2015-gold	answers-forums		It seems you don't understand the difference between Morphology and Phonology and therefore, the difference between morphemes and phonemes.	'Orthographically similar' might be another term you can use, meaning 'spelled similarly'.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		This answer does not address the source of the Vietnamese word, just the Vietnamese/Lao connection.	Different languages produce their vowels at different positions in the mouth.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		According to this WALS page "Passive Constructions", there are five necessary properties of a passive construction.	You may want to start with an excellent review by Leonid Kulikov.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		What could really be hardly translated into Russian is 'privacy' (although some might disagree stating that it is translated as покой).	The Western Desert Language in Australia does not have a word directly equivalent to English 'love'.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		In traditional Principles and Parameters Framework 1, noun phrases (NP) are considered the topmost lexical head.	These are two different representations that depend on your assumption.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		The Farsi word "جادو" /dʒɒ:du:/ is thought to be cognate with Sanskrit "यातु" /ja:tu/, with a similar meaning.	Avestan yātu-, Middle Persian jādūg, New Persian jādū all mean “sorcerer”, though the NP word is also used for “sorcery” (MP.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		passenger: How long will the bus stay at the station?	This kind of phonological ambiguity is frequent enough, also because sound may be distorted.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Latin semen comes from sero, "to sow", which in turn comes from the Proto-Indo-European *sē(i)-, "to sow".	Hebrew šɛmɛn שמן “oil, fat” is a Semitic cognate of Arabic samn سمن “fat, butter” (with Semitic s1).
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		You are right - it is the vibration of the vocal cord that adds "voice".	Normally, English "k", "t" and "p" are always aspirated, so they have a very slight "h" sound right after them.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		British popular singers do tend to sound American -- but obviously not the choristers at King's College!	I think the academic phonological analysis is true only to a small extent.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		It was too long for the comment, so had to post it as an answer.	@Alenanno's answer is great, but there is yet another factor: conspiracy.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Jane, I disagree on two points: Hebrew wasn’t (morphologically) simplified because of European Jews; it was mainly syntactically Europeanised.	Interesting response from Ron Maimon, although I am not sure I understand it fully.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I can think of two main factors which would motivate such a decision.	This is not a scientific account, it may not be accurate, nor am i an expert on the subject.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		As pointed out by others, "true synonyms" do not exist.	I think the word you are looking for is plesionym.

STS2015-gold	answers-forums		There's actually been a lot of work on this kind of issue in morphosyntax.	I don't see why a definite article suffix and "definiteness" as a noun property contradict each other.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		In medieval Christian theology, things that were left-handed were things that belonged to Satan (or were corrupted by him).	The English word "right" comes from Proto-Indo-European word o̯reĝtos which meant "correct" and had cognates o̯reĝr "directive, order", o̯reĝs "king, ruler", o̯reĝti "guides, directs", o̯reĝi̯om "kingdom".

STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I evaluate based on what my parents did or didn't do.	If you are asking the question, then that's all that matters.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		This is anecdotal, but: One of my cousins had a similar problem when he was a child.	As the comments have said, don't be afraid to ask your pediatrician about it, since it worries you.

STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Another issue you might want to consider is that as cats get older their colon response gets weaker.	In general I'd say one should feed cats wet food instead of dry.

STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Off the top of my head, I think it's better to look at the criteria you've proffered for identifying "God".	A good argument I have seen against the existence of a God is based on Occam's Razor.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		The existence of different logics is interesting, but not particularly relevant, because of Gödel/Turing universality.	In today's mathematics, we have many variants of logic (propositional, first order, higher order, fuzzy logic, etc.).

STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Our greatest asset For comparison, basically, human and animal have similar purpose in life, those are, survival and enjoyment.	Cicero's Hortensius, though effectively lost to us, appears to have been an answer to this very question.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		First, you must be using humanist in an idiosyncratic way.	If everyone can create "meaning" based on personal preference not some philosophical idea it will amount to contradiction.

STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Use a high speed page feed scanner like the DR-2010C from Canon.	Another suggestion: wait until you have money to throw at the problem.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		You can use free, open-source utility Exiftool to extract the metadata from the JPG files.	Why not stop using JPEG images and use RAW exclusively?
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Two things need to be considered here: focusing speed and adequate sensitivity to light to achieve a fast shutter speed.	Often a faster lens will be sharper even at the same aperture as a cheaper lens.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I think this is an example of: use the opportunities you have, rather than the ones you wish you had.	Polarizers and neutral density filters will go a long way to help this, but they are not a panacea.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		There's really only one thing you need to memorize and it's easy: a list of standard f-stops in graduations of one f-stop (1, 1.4, 2, 2.8, 4, 5.6, 8, 11, 16, 22, 32, 45, 64, 90).	For the exposure, you can try an analog light-meter, like the Gossen Lunasix.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I upgraded from 400D to 7D and things just got sharper (and you should expect the same).	It has to do with the sensor size - large sensors require correspondingly larger lenses.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Reid is right - that VR does not help at all in stopping motion.	Completely agree with Reid... in this situation a fast prime is the way to go.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		In short: you can enlarge it as much as you like.	That all depends on the viewing distance, and, to a lesser degree the brand, age and speed of the film.

STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Sometimes the amount of exposure compensation available (ie +/- 2 stops) in Aperture priority mode might simply not be enough.	Manual mode can give you more consistent metering when you're taking several photos in a scene.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		The camera will only ever do a "quick format" as there is a limit on read/write operations on flash memory.	I format my card every time I stick it in my camera and start a shoot.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I have the 35mm 1.8 and the 50mm 1.4 - and for people wanting thier 1st fixed prime I always point them at the 35mm 1.8 1st.	Only when we consider all these factors do we come up with a 'normal' focal length value of about 50mm.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	0.40	For what it's worth, dirt on the lens might not be as detrimental as you would think.	Regular dish washing fluid is great for removing grease, as it not only dissolves it but also binds it.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Polarizers do block light, as they are designed to filter out light coming from certain directions.	Aside from focal length, the most important thing to consider is the maximum aperture of the lens.

STS2015-gold	answers-forums		There are many races in the Star Trek universe that are so near-human there may be no discernible difference.	Humans in the Star Trek universe are expansionistic, not self-destructive, and breed easier than similar species.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I think Voldemort's arrogance has to be included in the equation.	Voldemort probably thought he was very clever, stumbling upon the Room of Requirement.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Storm Front is probably the worst of the Dresden books.	Never read the Hollows, but can answer the parts about the Dresden universe.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		The best explanation comes from Picard in Star Trek: First Contact.	There was definitely a money system in the Star Trek Universe.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I would start with the Chronicles and move on to the Legends series.	Mark Roger's answer of Chronicles, Legends, and Tales is a good answer.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		We know that the Puppeteer homeworld achieved 3% of the speed of light in 8 years, according to Juggler of Worlds.	How close to the Ringworld was the Fleet of Worlds?
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		This comes from "The Gripping Hand", the sequel to "The Mote in God's Eye".	The way I understand the history, the concept of a “gripping hand” did originate in The Mote in God's Eye (published in 1974).

STS2015-gold	answers-forums		Well, first, I think it's because Harry is better than Hermione at Defence Against the Dark Arts in general.	The Patronus Charm, according to the Harry Potter series, is a powerful spell.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I'd say yes, he was a Sith - just not a very good one.	Going by the Rule of Two, Vader can only become a Sith master if he strikes down the Emperor himself.

STS2015-gold	answers-forums		This is an Alderson Disk and has been featured in Godwheel.	It could be Pratchett, he has written stories other than those in Discworld; one of them is Strata.

STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I think it largely depends on what kind of "children's book" we're talking about.	Actually, this is the only situation where run-on sentences should be used (and work better than short sentences).
STS2015-gold	answers-forums	3.00	The villains I absolutely hate are selfish and self-serving, but they are also cowards.	A villain you want to take down is, at his/her core, someone who does not care about the suffering of others.

STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I find the repetitive use of the same verb in a paragraph to be jarring.	Markdown is almost certainly the way to go for simple formatting.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I have tried to write in XML and latex but neither seems very stream lined for fiction.	As mentioned above, I ended up developing my own tools and markup language to suit my needs.

STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I use OneNote and I think it's the best computer program ever happened.	I really like the idea of a small notebook, and I'd recommend that.
STS2015-gold	answers-forums		I don't think 'actually' is particularly casual, and I agree with Dale Emery that the other words have different meanings.	The intention of the reviewer seems to be to avoid words that may reflect personal opinion.

STS2015-gold	answers-forums		David Gerrold has always shied away from numbering chapters; he just puts in a section break and keeps writing.	Austerlitz by W. G. Sebald consists of a handful of paragraphs, each of 50 or so pages.

STS2015-gold	belief		the high court declared the case against the machines moot since the justice department has now cleared the machines, and ordered another part back to court to decide a fight over attorney fees.	both sides could have used better attorneys on this, the arguments dance around the real issues and ignore the facts - on both sides.
STS2015-gold	belief		problem i see is not the color of people that live in here and not from where they come.	problem is clinton did something no other president did, he violated the oval office by having sex thaere and then lying about it.
